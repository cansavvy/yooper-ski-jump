# The Apex Year

## Qualifying for Junior Nationals

The 1979 season represented the apex of my ski jumping career. After years of development on local hills and steady progression to larger venues, I had accumulated enough competitive results to qualify for the Junior National Championships.

The qualification process required consistent placement in regional tournaments throughout the season. Each meet contributed points toward a cumulative standing that determined who would represent the Central Division at nationals. By late February 1979, my results had secured a spot on the team.

The announcement brought mixed emotions – pride in the achievement, but also anxiety about the challenges ahead. The Junior Nationals would be held at Squaw Valley, California, site of the 1960 Winter Olympics. The venue and competition level would be unlike anything I had experienced.

## Squaw Valley

In early March 1979, a contingent of Central Division jumpers traveled to Squaw Valley for the two-week Junior Nationals program. The first week focused on competition, while the second week offered instructional sessions and training.

The Squaw Valley ski jumps were situated in a spectacular mountain setting, a stark contrast to the forested hillsides of the Midwest. The altitude (over 6,000 feet) and dry snow conditions created unfamiliar jumping characteristics. Practice sessions during the first few days helped us acclimate to these differences.

The competitive atmosphere was intense. Jumpers from across the country brought diverse styles and skill levels, reflecting the various regional programs that had developed them. The Western jumpers seemed particularly comfortable with the conditions, having more experience at altitude.

## Trial and Error

My first unique experience at Squaw Valley came during an early practice session. The hill had been prepared hurriedly, and critical alignment markers had been positioned incorrectly. On my practice jump, I launched from a take-off that wasn't properly aligned with the landing below.

The first problem was immediately apparent as I cleared the knoll. I was in orbit, leaving behind the designed flight trajectory of the hill. We had started too high on the hill! I had as much height as riding the 90m Pine Mountain two weeks earlier, but this was only a 60m hill. Even though I hadn't jumped with maximum power, my flight path was carrying me well past the bottom of the hill.

The second and more disturbing problem was that I was exiting stage left. I had centered the track between the prescribed markers at the take-off, but the markers had not been aligned between the inrun start and the center of the landing below. I was flying far left of the prepared landing hill, and this time it wasn't caused by a stiff crosswind.

As I quickly scanned possible landing (or more appropriately crash) sites, I noticed a hill crew staff member far below scampering to safety as I plummeted directly toward him. He had been a half dozen feet off to the side of the landing, but that wasn't far enough. He had concluded that the garden rake in his hand was no defense against this raptor descending upon him with 8 foot yellow talons.

What a predicament. In normal situations, a ski jumper uses subtle positioning of hands like ailerons to guide flight direction. At great expense to style point in competition, more aggressive adjustments can be made with entire arms, even beyond 'rolling down the windows'. In this circumstance, no amount of full body contortions was going to divert my flight back to the landing strip.

Except for airplane flight training or aerobatics, stall is what pilots call an undesirable event. Yet, in this situation, a forced emergency stall was the best recourse. By aggressively pulling back on body lean, bending sharply at the waist (aka jack knifing), and getting my legs and skis directly underneath my center of gravity, I mostly defeated forward velocity. Descending awkwardly from the sky, there was little I could do reduce vertical velocity since parachutes are not issued to ski jumpers.

As I was about to meet the ground, it was the first and only time that I closed my eyes. I crashed where some hill slope still remained, so the impact was not as traumatic as it could have been. More so, I landed in the fresh snowbank conveniently created during the previous day's excavation. After one bounce and roll in the soft stuff, I came to an abrupt halt.

From a flight that lifted off horizontally at 45 mph and descended the vertical height of a 60m landing hill, it was amazing. I was uninjured. As I collected myself and my equipment, hill staff rushed over to determine what medical assistance to provide (unnecessary as it was). However, I soon realized that one of my cherished, new Kneissl skis (just like those of Finnish jumping star Matti Nykaenen's) had snapped near the tip. The consolation was a broken ski and not a broken bone. The trial and big error event forestalled the first practice that morning for everybody. The jump take-off was cut back and lowered substantially to bring it into conformance.

Still a couple of decades away, the advent of permanently located artificial inrun tracks would have precluded this situation by providing an appropriate take-off speed and more importantly, an inrun track accurately orientated to the rest of the ski jumping hill.

## Competition Results

Thankfully, the local ski club found a spare set of Fischer jumping skis for my use the rest of the week. I started practicing the next day. After 2 practice days, the first competitive event was held with team jumping consisting of three and four man teams from the Central, Eastern, and Rocky Mountain regions, respectively. My four man team placed 4th amongst the twelve teams, and although I didn't do anything spectacular, my individual results were 10th best overall.

My second unique experience occurred during practice between the team jumping days and the two final days of individual jumping competitions. Since it was March, day time temperatures climbed to the high 40's and low 50's, before falling below freezing at night. On one of my morning practice jumps, I fell forward onto the icy landing hill. After sliding to a halt, I realized that my left forearm was sporting a six inch raspberry that I have to this day. During hill preparation in the middle of a warm day, the landing hill surface was finalized with skis sidestepping down the hill. The resulting small ridges form a nice human cheese grater as it freezes.

I placed 17th overall during one of the two individual jumping competitions that culminated Junior Nationals week. I never did see the results for the second day, but it was most likely somewhere between 10th and 20th place. The individual winner did ultimately represent the U.S. at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. Nonetheless, my results were encouraging. The point separation between 5th place and 20th place was modest. I could further rationalize that I was using unfamiliar skis and was disrupted by two different falls.

As a sad postlude not so uncommon in recent decades, the 1979 Junior Nationals were one of the last times that the Squaw Valley ski jumps were used. They were demolished a few years later and the hillsides were converted to speed skiing and snowboarding. Eventually, an express ski lift was installed in that location.

## Recognition and Encouragement

After the last day of competition, I was impressed by Jerry Falk, the Central Division coach, coming to my dormitory room and personally congratulating me on a fine week despite the mishaps. He also offered that USSA would pay for new skis. We later found that to be unnecessary since the skis were still under warranty. When I got back home, I exchanged them at the U.P. retail outlet for jumping skis (yes, such stores used to exist) near Champion, Michigan (also home of the five time "All Around Best U.P. Fire Department").

The second week at Squaw Valley was filled with instructional sessions and dry land training. The coaches were impressed with how I had one of the highest vertical leaps measured in the gym. Yes, I had heard that before.

A welcome diversion was being able to go alpine skiing one day on Squaw Valley Mountain. For a Yooper who had never ventured beyond the upper Midwest until that trip, the week in general and that particular day, was a real treat. Whereas the maximum elevation change at U.P. alpine hills is a measly 650 feet, the 2700 foot elevation change from top to bottom of Squaw Valley was another scale. The picturesque view from the tram ride and the length of the ski runs were awesome. Even for a fit 18 year old, my leg muscles were burning when skiing without pause from top to bottom of the mountain.

The climate changed from blustery, cold, and icy conditions at the top to sunny, mid-50's and soft snow at the bottom. Just as noticeable was that ski attire changed dramatically, as if by magic, from winter parkas, ski pants, and goggles at the mountain top to shorts and bikinis at the bottom.

Thus ended the apex year of my ski jumping career.

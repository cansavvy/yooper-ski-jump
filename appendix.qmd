## Appendix 1 - Ski Jump Classification

In recent decades, several factors have contributed to the resizing and reclassification of ski jumps, including Suicide Hill, as mentioned earlier. Suicide was reclassified from 70m to a larger (90m) hill size by reasons of it being (a) physically modified to enable longer jumps, and (b) the international standard for classification being revised according to the K-point, rather than the P-point (as explained below). 

![Basic Ski Jump Hill Terminology](resources/images/book/basic-ski-jump-terminology.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

- As with many jumps around the world, longer jumps are made possible by lengthening the steep portion of the landing hill. For most hills, this entails digging the landing hill transition deeper into the terrain. On some hills, it has to be accompanied by lengthening the inrun for more speed and/or moving the take-off higher up the hill.

- Secondly, the method of classifying a ski jump hill size has evolved to now using the K-Point (or 'K'), instead of the P-point. Hill size for many decades was defined by the P-point, generally explained as the distance from the take-off to the point on the landing hill where the curvature of the knoll ends and the steepest, constant slope portion of the landing hill begins. The critical point ('K') is a point farther down the hill where the steepest, constant slope section (from 'P' to 'K') ends and the hill begins to flatten out.

In a conventional hill set up, the vast majority of the jumpers should be landing somewhere between 'P' and 'K'. 'K' is also called the construction point in today's nomenclature. In competition, 'K' is used as the reference distance upon which distance points are calculated and added to (or subtracted) from style points. If a jumper reaches 'K', he has had a competitive jump.

If a jumper flies significantly past 'K' and lands on the increasingly flatter slope, the increasing impact on the jumper's body can compromise his safety. Based on results from trial rides prior to the tournament, speed and distance for the ensuing competition is determined by officials selecting the inrun gate at the top of the hill that moderates the number of jumpers exceeding 'K'.

In 2004 there was another development. The FIS redefined hill size according to yep, the Hill Size point (HS). This is the maximum distance that a jumper can still expect to land safely. It is downhill of the 'K' point, approaching the dip of the landing. HS and hill record should be in close proximity. The prevailing opinion is that the 'K' designation of a hill is still the most useful and consistent indicator of hill size and pertinent to competitive results. Conversely, for solely marketing purposes for long distance and hill records, then HS is the better dimension to use.

Based on data from several sources, hill size proportions are illustrated below that includes hill sizes of;

- prominent U.P. hills, i.e. Wolverine, Suicide, Pine Mountain, and Copper Peak.
- Olympic standards, i.e. Olympics Normal and Olympics Large.
- FIS designated classes, i.e. Small, Medium, Normal, Large, Giant, and Ski Flying.

*Note: Depending on the reference chosen, there are either 5 or 6 hill size steps. For purposes here, the six step naming convention is adopted, which includes the Giant range. It provides better resolution between Large and the ever-expanding Ski Flying range.*

Per the figure above, the green bars encompass the range of normal flight distances, spanning from slightly uphill of 'P' and down to 'K'. Light blue bars indicate the range from 'K' to the maximum safe distance 'HS', for which the hill is designed. Official records are also marked, which exceed the 'HS' designed maximum on some hills.

With its inaugural tournament in 1970, Copper Peak was classified as the only Ski Flying hill in North America, and one of six worldwide. During the past few decades, hill enlargement has continued on all other Ski Flying hills except Copper Peak. Per the updated FIS classification method, Copper Peak should now be designated as a Giant hill.

Another pertinent observation is that Pine Mountain and Suicide straddle hill sizes specified for the Olympics, thus offering a progression of hill sizes necessary for regional and national ski jumper development. Meanwhile, Wolverine was a noteworthy stepping stone from Small to Olympic size hills.

Pine Mountain is classified as a Large ski jump now. Yet, the distinction between it and Copper Peak is nearly blurred in terms of longest recorded distances. Copper Peak's hill record has been standing still at 518 feet since its last meet in 1994 while in subsequent years continued modifications to Pine Mountain has yielded the current record of 472 feet that is within 10% (or less than 50 feet) of Copper Peak's record and its 1970 vintage hill design.

## Appendix 2 – Hill Preparation

Ski jump hill snow surface preparation continues to evolved into a science. In the 70's, the creation of supersized hills, such as Copper Peak, forced innovation. Wally Kusz, Leno Slanzi, Bob Shea and several others had to be creative to deal with the sheer size of Copper Peak's inrun and landing hill. With a relatively small crew at hand, a large scale snow sled was pulled up the massive landing by a cable and pulley system attached to a bulldozer at the bottom of the hill (1). To snow the 469 foot inrun, sacks of snow got an elevator ride to snow the scaffold top and a smaller sled was used to snow the lower inrun portions.

On smaller hills in the 1970's, such as the Iron Bowl and Wolverine, most of the work was purely manual. The Ironwood Daily Globe always did a fine job of supporting local ski jumping, even alluding to the physical workout associated with getting the 55m in tournament shape after another hefty snowfall.

Instead of my repeated emphasis in this memoir that hill preparation was a labor intensive task, I could choose to look at hill preparation as our own form of cross training. In one instance, the local Daily Globe newspaper included a feature photograph of some lean 18 year old lad with his trusty Yooper scoop clearing the landing of excess snow. The lad was apparently hoping to ride that day (didn't happen) since he had his jumping suit and boots on while pushing snow off the hill and working up a sweat.

![Scooping The Wolverine Outrun](resources/images/book/scooping-the-wolverine-outrun.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

After completing the first step of clearing the hill of the soft fluffy stuff that is not conducive for creating a firm, fast surface, the available team divides and conquers the remaining preparation of the landing hill and the scaffold / inrun. Professional grooming of a major league baseball infield may be landscaping art, but the snowscaping skill applied to final preparation of ski jump surfaces is no child's play, either. A garden rake and a shovel are the essential tools of ignorance, at least for most hills where larger or advanced equipment is not available. The careful leveling and smoothing of any ripples over the hundreds of feet of inrun length and its curvature are done with care and pride. For major hills and events, specially designed mechanical sleds (ex: a ski jump inrun tiller) have become standard in the past few decades.

Today, the major international and more prominent regional jumps have an inrun track of standardized width and depth incorporating composite materials consisting of ceramic, porcelain, or thermoplastic, complemented by controlled cooling systems. So, near uniform track friction is assured. If the cost can be justified, a technologically superior artificial track eliminates inrun speed variance, at least as a function of weather. On those hills, gone are the days when jumpers hoped that inrun preparation included 'sugar' snow, the small granular snow-ice particles that forms naturally after several days or weeks of sunlight 'seasoning'. Sugar snow was a skiers delight for consistent speed and tracking.

In the past, the track speed can vary widely. In rare instances, especially near the end of a long practice or meet day, the inrun can transform into solid ice. Conversely, if heavy, wet snow falls so rapidly that the track can't be kept clear, the resulting snail slow track speed caused by excessive suction on the ski bottom renders skiing impractical. Two of us tried practice riding Wolverine one day when soft, wet snow was falling heavily. The resulting speed at take-off was so slow that we pounded the top of the knoll. It was an unexpected encore to the half-scaffold Iron Bowl stunt attempted a half decade earlier.

Preparation of the landing hill is less meticulous, but more laborious. Diligence is required to create a smooth, firm landing plane that follows the contour of the designed hill profile over a much wider and longer distance than the narrow inrun. Without heavy equipment available, the work was/is purely manual. The large ski jumping skis are well suited for much of this task. After scraping (or using gravity to effectively plow excess soft snow sideways down the hill with skis), it can be more easily discarded to the side.

Final sidestepping is an acquired skill. It involves short hopping (akin to jumping rope) simultaneously with both skis progressing steadily down the hill an inch or two with each hop while maintaining ski edges on the steep slope. The resulting small, closely spaced snow ridges running perpendicular to the length of the landing are a beauty to behold. Or so we thought when admiring our handiwork.

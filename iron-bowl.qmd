# The Iron Bowl

The primary (and largest) ski jump was the 30m, where jumping distances in excess of 100 feet were readily achievable. The contours of the inrun and landing were designed by Supercynski in compliance with evolving jumping hill standards of the time, including a 10° downward sloping take-off table. The upper half of the inrun consisted of a 25 foot high scaffold of creosoted telephone poles and frugally obtained plank lumber. The scaffold merged into a graded rock slope transitioning to the take-off table. Construction of the Iron Bowl was completed in time for the inaugural meet in 1969.

With a new set of small jumping hills in place, GRSC launched a concerted effort to build the foundation of a ski jumping program, aided by local advertising. Though the quiet Finlander that he was, Dad still had ears to the ski jumping community.

By then in his late 30's, Dad had fond memories of the defunct 30m Quarry Hill ski jump previously located in the Caves east of the Iron Bowl, where he competed in the early 1950's. However, his favorite ski jump was the 35m Dynamite located just north of US2 and west of Section 12 Road on a bluff less than two miles from the Savonen family homestead.

## First Jump

So, one early winter Sunday in 1970, Dad took me to the Iron Bowl. There were about a dozen jumpers present, most of them using the largest (30m) hill. And that's where we met Walter (Wally) Kusz, the chief orchestrator. We were enthusiastically welcomed, and after some discussion, I was coaxed to try riding the smaller landing hill.

Snapping on my alpine skis on the knoll, I mustered the courage and slowly snowplow turned to start heading downhill. The hill surface was very smooth. As I steadily picked up speed, I didn't expect that the slope would increase so rapidly and continuously. When I reached the steepest part of the downhill slope, and could finally see the bottom of the hill, it felt like I was going straight down. I hadn't signed up for this.

After another moment of descent, I bailed (sat down), and spun out. Sheepish though I was, Dad and others encouraged me to try again, while leaning forward into the downhill slope. On the second try, I did just that and then crouched low to the ground to stay upright through the transition (or dip) at the bottom of the landing hill. By 3rd or 4th try, I conquered the entire landing hill in a wobbly, but fully upright fashion. "I guess I'll come back tomorrow".

**Knoll** – the relatively flat part of the landing hill starting at the end of the jump (take-off table) and ending after transitioning to a steeper constant part of the landing slope between the P-Point and the K-Point. Jumping hills are designed for ski jumpers to land after the knoll on the steeper slope that follows.

How time flies! Just 6 years later, I enjoyed my small part in helping prepare the Copper Peak landing hill, holding onto ropes while sidestepping and panking the hundreds of yards of the 40° sloped landing hill. Besides watching the tournament, my personal thrill as an early teen was the opportunity to ride the entire Copper Peak landing hill while crouched in an inrun tuck position the entire distance. It was speed to burn, baby and no radar in the area. I am sure that it was the fastest that I ever traveled on skis, and had to be well in excess of 70 mph considering that ski flyers reach the low to mid-60's shooting down an inrun that is considerably shorter than the landing hill.

Alongside the inrun of the 30m Iron Bowl jump and its scaffold, a 2-foot high snow bump was angled into the main landing hill, creating a 15m capable jump. Although the maximum achievable jumping distance was maybe 45 feet, beginners could experience the exhilaration of ski jumping and aerodynamic lift for the first time.

## Getting Real Equipment

We modified my alpine equipment to partially resemble jumping skis, at least so the ski boot heel could lift from the ski, enabling a forward lean in the air like a genuine ski jumper. With most alpine ski bindings of that era, the back of the ski boot rigidly attached to the ski by a cable wrapping around the heel. By removing the two cable guides on the sides of the ski closest to the heel, the heel was free to lift from the ski.

After I used the modified alpine skis for a few months, Dad obtained a set of used, but actual jumping skis. Real jumping skis with wood-fiberglass composite core and five grooves on the plastic bottom surface! They were 50% wider, 70% longer, and at least 3 – 4 times heavier than my little alpine skis. If I was alpine skiing in the evening following a day of ski jumping, muscle memory made those alpine skis feel like toothpicks. Those dark blue Elan jumping skis provided an early 70's luxury Cadillac smooth, muscle car Trans Am fast ride. In a drag race down the landing hill, anyone with jumping skis would surge past the alpine skier like any other car passing Dad's '59 Studebaker struggling up Birch Hill. At 255 cm long (8 foot 4 inches), the jumping skis were 6 - 8 inches oversized for my 5 foot and change height at the time, but I didn't care.

## Learning from Wally

During ensuing weekends, a few of us youngsters were introduced to the actual sport of ski jumping. While Dad facilitated my interest and introduction to ski jumping, Wally Kusz was my first (and realistically only) ski jumping coach, with all due respect to many others who gave me an occasional tip or guidance over the years. With a distinct accent, as did nearly every first or second generation Yooper, he exuded an infectious enthusiasm. He also had a keen eye for identifying minor deviations from the fundamentals that he knew would yield success on any jumping hill, as he would emphasize:

> "It's all in takeoff."

> "Timing is crucial. Don't jump too early or too late."

> "In the inrun, keep your shin angle forward, back flat and level, and head up."

> "When you jump, explode, keeping your chest down, and head level."

> "Never, ever drop your head."

> "When in the air, your body follows your head, just like a bird. So, always keep your head up and steady, while looking out over your skis and stretching for the bottom of the hill."

Wally described the lift during the early stages of flight over the knoll as someone grabbing you by the back of your belt. Until then, my only reference of someone being grabbed and lifted by the back of the belt came from our 4th grade teacher. One day he escorted another misbehaving and then petrified classmate horizontally out of the classroom by the back of his belt, while he frantically hand surfed across classmates' desks on the way to the principal's office. Well, that was 1969 classroom discipline.

In a not so obvious parallel to hitting a baseball on the sweet spot of the bat barrel, a perfectly executed ski jump produces longer distances with seemingly minimal effort. The primary elements to achieving that ski jumping sweet spot is nailing the timing exactly with a quick and powerful take-off and transitioning quickly and smoothly to an optimal flight position. The fruits of all that are extra lift, and after clearing the knoll, an extended, almost weightless flight peering over skis and sighting beyond the hill bottom.

## The Telemark Landing

After a few months of riding the Iron Bowl, landing was not an issue. On the knoll and flatter landing slope of a small hill like the Iron Bowl, you could land in an upright alpine ski position and easily maintain balance. But, landing in proper 'telemark' style had to be learned for the sake of style points.

A landing in telemark style reduces the chance of falling and mitigates impact damage to knees. One ski is advanced further than the other, and the jumper is in a squat-like position with knees flexed, like a shock absorber.

The telemark derives its name from the Telemark region in Norway, a birthplace of downhill as well as cross country skiing, and ski jumping. A telemark-like position is also used when a cross country skier slows down or negotiates a turn. To get technical, tele (Greek) means 'far' or 'at a distance'.

## Learning the Hard Way

In my first November on the Iron Bowl, after a few weeks of practice, we had our first mini-meet for local jumpers. What distinguished a tournament day from practice was that you came dressed in your best clothing, like a fancy jacket and stretch pants.

Anyway, for this special occasion, I was eager to show my stuff when family, friends, and club members were in attendance. I had earlier demonstrated decent competence on the 30m, so I started using the 30m inrun ramp.

Overanxious to impress the crowd during one of my first three-ride tournament rounds, I misjudged my approach to the take-off. This is called jumping early. What happens is that most of the energy of the take-off is expended in the vertical direction, and not into a smooth horizontal trajectory. In skiing parlance, I popped. Popping will yield a brief but dramatic amount of time in the air, but not a lot of distance. And then, in the spirit of rapid learning, I made it worse.

As I came down from the apex of the pop, my center of gravity was not directly above my skis, so I had to scramble to center my body. In a fleeting moment of desperation, I concluded that the only way to land gracefully was to abandon one of my skis. I lifted my left leg and ski toward the armpit of my beautiful new, but now slashed, jacket. I landed upright, albeit like a flamingo, on one ski to a round of applause and a sprinkling of laughter. It was an embarrassing highlight captured in a newspaper feature photo, but a fellow jumper won the actual photo contest for that night. His picture captured an airborne leap in Daescher form with the local newspaper headline reading "Ride of a Lifetime". Ah, but what a contrast between a nicely executed flight and an awkward landing.

## Iron Bowl Characters

When convening many winter evenings at the Iron Bowl hill, one becomes acquainted with the jumping styles and personalities of fellow jumpers. There was little formal coaching, but fellow jumpers tended to encourage each other. Most Iron Bowl jumpers in the early 70's were accomplished high school or former athletes in other sports. In a sense, they were the unintentional forerunners of today's sport culture awakening to the physical and mental benefits of youngsters participating in multiple sports across all four seasons.

When I was in elementary school, most of my fellow local jumpers were in high school. It included football and wrestling stars and family legacy jumpers, with colorful personalities amongst all of them. The unique challenges and thrills of ski jumping attracted a diverse group.

One of our all sport high school stars was having a mediocre ski jumping evening that didn't measure up to his own Type-A expectations, despite being unable to consistently give attention to the sport. At the bottom of the hill after what turned out to be his last jump of the night, he ripped off his skis and threw them like javelins twenty yards into the deep snow while expletives cascaded across the walls of the Iron Bowl ravine. We didn't see him much after that.

One of the senior cats still jumping well past age 40 (after he started to ski jump in his 30's) was Bob Shea. Although Bob wasn't a ski jumping Olympian, he had the heart of a ski jumper and was part of the ski club soul for many years. As with all ski jumping hills, the Iron Bowl hill had a unique personality.

By the late 1970's, when there were less than a handful of us still jumping locally (by then at Wolverine), Bob would periodically take a break from cross country skiing to watch a few of our jumps. After complementing one of my practice rides, he did not hesitate to plant the vision of going to the Olympics. Little did he know that that goal was already quietly embedded at the top of my list. But, it gave credence to my little vision when hearing someone else speak out loud to the belief that it was an achievable goal.

## The Free Spirit

Another fellow jumper was athletic, but he wasn't an athlete, meaning he couldn't muster complete commitment to the sport. That didn't lessen the enjoyment he got from recreational participation. Typical of most ski jumpers, he was part of a ski jumping family legacy.

On the side, he was reputedly active in small scale pot distribution. Whereas today, each new cannabis business opening of the now multi-billion-dollar Michigan industry is celebrated with mayoral ribbon cutting and a front page story in the local Daily Globe newspaper, in the 70's it was necessarily underground and stigmatized. Anyway, this free spirit and purported cannabis distributor had a fun loving, outgoing personality.

When putting on his skis at the top of the Iron Bowl scaffold one evening, he stepped into the ski toeplates as usual, but absentmindedly forgot to attach the cables to the back of his boots before launching down the inrun. OK, admittedly the Iron Bowl lights did not fully illuminate the top platform of the scaffold and he wasn't the most detailed oriented guy, or maybe it was just an extra hazy day.

In retrospect, we watched an amazingly smooth inrun ride until he reached the end of jump. At that point, Kaos triumphed over Control. Normally, our Maxwell Smart had the habit of letting his skis spread apart just before take-off, abandoning the set inrun tracks. Perhaps it was his 'drawing outside the lines' metaphor for life.

But in this particular situation, he was fortunate. As he cleared the jump, a detached left ski dived to the left and a similarly free right ski dived to the right. In ski jumping slang, he was 'rolling down the windows' as he frantically windmilled his arms while flying past those of us standing on the knoll.

The center of the landing hill waited to receive him as he completed his 35 mph airwalk. Fortunately, due to good jumping hill design, our pal encountered a soft landing. He achieved an unofficial distance of 40 feet, although I think his skis flew further. He was uninjured, unfazed, and after trudging through the deep snow on both sides of the landing to retrieve his wayward skis, he was ready to go for another ride. We all hooted and laughed, including him.

## Safety and Helmets

As detailed later, although serious injuries are rare in this sport, the worst case situation is a head injury, if impacting hard with skis or ground. Helmets didn't become standard ski jumping equipment until stipulated by the USSA in the mid-70's. At that time, even ski flyers usually wore a soft cotton ski cap or beanie. Some ski flyers wore neither goggles nor any head covering.

*Peter Wilson of the Canadian National Team garnered 4th place in 1973 on the huge ski flying Copper Peak hill. As captured above, he approaches his landing without compromising style.*

However, by the late 70's, anyone expecting to compete in a USSA sanctioned meet had to wear a helmet. The first editions of ski jumping helmets were not stylish. The available soft plastic cap resembled an early 1900's bathing cap adorned with colorful soft foam rectangular ridges. For that brief period, it could be embarrassing to a style conscious teen, but we were all in the same boat probably thinking, but not saying "Hey, you're a circus clown, too."

Thankfully, just a couple of years later, the equipment standard had graduated to a classical hard outer shell 'sphere', akin to what contact and automotive sports had been using for years. With that type of helmet and goggles in place, I felt very safe in my own little world, regardless of the size of the hill or others around me.

## The End of the Iron Bowl Era

During the span of 1972-1974, I was fortunate to be the Ironwood Schools city alpine ski champion in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. It included the disciplines of slalom, giant slalom, and downhill. In the 'woulda' category, I woulda been the 5th grade champion, too, but I took the wrong side of the last gate in the slalom run.

Theron Peterson, the veteran Ironwood High coach of alpine skiing and several other sports, urged me to join the alpine team. I was honored, but I regrettably felt it was necessary to decline. During the compressed winter season, I didn't know how I could do justice to both ski sports and for that matter, how my parents could absorb the additional cost of a second sport. Nevertheless, periodic recreational alpine skiing provided valuable cross training that benefitted ski jumping balance and agility.

As mentioned by Supercynski, a limited number of years remained for continued use of the Iron Bowl, since the Ironwood municipal authority was clamoring for more landfill space in the Caves property that they controlled. And even more problematically, with years passing since the underground mines were abandoned, the steadily rising water table would eventually peek above ground in the bottom of the Caves ravine.

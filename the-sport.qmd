# The Sport

## Physical + Mental

What about the broader view of the sport? Even though the popularity of ski jumping in the U.S. has waned over recent decades, its merits are still compelling. This centuries old pastime fulfills the pursuit of an intense, high speed, anaerobic athletic challenge. In short, ski jumping demands unique physical prowess and mental fortitude. Yet, both a novice and an international champion can safely enjoy the thrills it offers. By these criteria, ski jumping is a top tier sport.

An aggregate of talents must be applied throughout the duration of what's called a ski jump that is much more than a jump, but has a prelude (inrun ramp), beginning (take-off), middle (flight), ending (landing) and postlude (transition to outrun). All of these jump segments must be mastered by an aggressive, but disciplined mindset that does not lose poise nor surrender to doubt, fear, or failure.

The excitement of ski jumping comes in multiple stages. Ski jumpers may be viewed as fear defying adrenaline junkies that have downhill skier instincts, embracing straightaway speed down the inrun ramp. Then, he must have a fearless commitment to make a gymnastic-like, cat quick leap precisely timed at take-off. Once in the air, he manages nearly weightless 'hang gliding-like' lift with subliminal neuromuscular coordination quickly adjusting to unpredictable air currents, before negotiating a feather soft landing. If the ski jumping 'pilot' masters all the subtleties of each ride stage, he will soar down the hill. Well, that's the goalposts.

Sure, if one can afford it, weightlessness can be simulated in 20 seconds of a parabolic airplane flight, just like astronauts practice. But the impression of speed is zilch. The lift and duration of a ski jumper's flight (2 – 8 seconds depending on the length of the ski jumper's flight), amidst variable conditions, is directly influenced by the athlete's skill. In a parabolic airplane flight, the conditions are created by the pilot while participant's influence on the result is minimized.

Sports that transcend the sole individual during competition are extra special. Successful team athletes allude to the joy of camaraderie while "climbing the mountain" together, celebrating, trusting, and picking up each other along the way. Sports that are more individually oriented, such as swimming, golf, or ski jumping, can also provide a similar level of fulfillment within a healthy club or team setting. In special circumstances, it is also evident across a community of competitors. Such was my experience with ski jumping.

## How Safe Is It?

OK, one may be attracted to a sport with thrills and skills, but how risky is ski jumping? With the growing sensitivity to safety in contemporary times, what is the actual (rather than widely believed), dangers of ski jumping? Unfortunately, potential new participants in ski jumping can be deterred, when in the interest of attracting audiences, ski jumping is erroneously portrayed as exceptionally dangerous. Sure, if one wants to toy with near death adrenaline levels, they might try wingsuit flying, but those risk-to-reward ratios are astronomically high. Such is just not the case with ski jumping.

What does the USA Nordic organization, an organization with a vested interest in the safety of its sport, say on the subject?

> "Ski jumping is a safe non-contact sport. Ski jumpers develop their jumping skills at their own pace. Each jumper starts out on the smallest hill with alpine skis, and progresses to the next larger hill when ready. Each skier progresses at a pace right for them with safety as the primary objective and with the input of experienced coaches who understand the importance of foundational skills necessary to keep jumping safe."

Within the overall sport of skiing, 2006 - 2008 FIS data concluded that injuries causing lost time for training or competitions on a per athlete basis was 15% - 35% less for ski jumping than that of alpine skiers and snowboarders.

A 2012 Consumer Product Safety Commission study revealed that for children ages 5 to 14 injuries for all types of skiing occurred at a rate of 2 per 100,000 participants. Yeah, two. All of the more common sports or activities (most of them involving some form of contact), such as football, basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer, and playground ranged from 51 (hockey) to 584 (football) injuries per 100,000 participants.

In studies of Winter Olympic injuries, less than 5% of ski jumpers incurred injuries, which is equivalent to curling! For all sports, 11% of participants were injured, with snowboard cross, freestyle skiing, bobsled, ice hockey, and short track being much higher than the average.

![Winter Olympic Injury Rates, By Sport](resources/images/book/winter-olympic-injury-rates.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

In a subsequent study of injury frequency for the 2914 athletes from 92 countries participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics at PyeongChang, South Korea. Data was compiled for percentage of athletes losing time for training or competition to injury. The data was broken into three segments, namely;

- Any injury that that forced some lost time.
- Injuries that forced time loss of greater than one day.
- Injuries that forced time loss greater than one week.

All injuries that prevented training or competing impacted less than 7% of the Meanwhile, half pipe skiing, snowboard cross and ski cross, snowboard slopestyle, and aerials led the injury parade at 4X – 5X that frequency. A majority of injuries in those sports resulted in longer downtimes. Amongst the intermediate to high range for injuries were alpine skiing, bobsled, ice hockey, speed skating, and luge. Figure skating, cross country skiing, and freestyle mogul skiing occupied the low end of injury scale. Trailing the entire pack with the least amount (<1%) of injuries are those gun toting biathlon folks (thankfully) and nordic combined (which includes ski jumping as part of their regimen).

If such data is initially surprising, further inspection should make it intuitive. The impressive aerial skills of halfpipe skiers executing multiple twists, turns, and inversions followed by a mostly vertical descent and (hopefully) an upright landing onto an uneven hard snow terrain makes even superior athletes susceptible to injury.

Another relatively new sport, ski cross (formally organized in 1986 and adopted as an Olympic sport in 2010), has four competitors simultaneously racing side by side down a course full of bumps and turns. Their objective is to survive a progression of exciting, but aptly named, knockout rounds to win a championship. The likelihood of contact or injury inducing falls are supported by the data. Without being too poetic, contrast that with a single, well trained ski jumper soaring majestically through the air and touching down gently on an expertly profiled and smoothly groomed landing hill.

Vinko Bogataj is the poster child for instilling alarm about ski jumping dangers. You almost certainly know of him, if you were born in the 90's or earlier. He's the poor chap from Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) whose cartwheel off the side of the inrun of a West German ski jump in March 1970 was immortalized as the Agony of Defeat at the beginning of every Wide World of Sports show before ABC cancelled the show in 1998.

A ski jumper of any skill level falling in the inrun is as rare as Halley's Comet swinging by Earth. The rest of Vinko's story is that he indeed suffered a concussion and broken ankle, but resumed training by June of that same year. Living in eastern Europe, he didn't know he was (in)famous until invited to a Wide World of Sports anniversary show in 1981 where Vinko received a standing ovation from a huge assembly of famous athletes, with Muhammad Ali himself requesting his autograph.

There is a combination of natural and trainable skills to reduce the possibility and/or severity of injury when a ski jumping fall occurs. Once it is obvious that a normal flight and landing is unrecoverable, the seriousness of the fall can usually be mitigated by piloting to a flat lying position and adhering to the hill surface as quickly as possible.

On the few times that I fell (usually 1 - 3 times per season), they were nearly all uneventful. I was fortunate to never hold a yard sale*, nor did I personally witness a fall by another jumper that required immediate medical attention. But, as I tease others when alpine skiing or playing euchre, if you aren't occasionally falling or failing, you aren't really pushing the boundaries and learning. 'Going to the edge' certainly applies to achieving winning times in alpine downhill skiing, but to a lesser degree in the discipline of ski jumping.

The natural public fascination with hill size feeds the perception that ski jumping is a hazardous spectacle, competing for an occasional spotlight with the obscure and the extreme. Progressive in one sense, the bygone ABC's Wide World of Sports gave unprecedented attention to humans tempting fate with gravity by motorcycle jumping, high wire acts, or tower diving by men or donkey, but ski jumping didn't deserve to be lumped with those daredevil shows.

Make no mistake, at the largest (ski flying) hill class, the risk does increase without extensive training and established hill safety protocol. The attention to subtle wind and hill conditions on the big hills has grown more sophisticated over the years. Extra diligence is given to qualifying a ski jumper to ski fly, based on his or her track record and awareness of his mental make-up.

But, with a little internet searching, one can find Go-Pro videos of the usual, safe, and successful ski jumping ride. With a camera attached to a ski jumper's helmet, the videos do not do justice to the entire ski jumping experience, of course. They do provide a decent introduction to sight lines of a jumper, and a good impression as to how steady a ski jumper's flight (usually) is.

To cap the safety discussion, the age old quote "Most people use statistics like a drunk man uses a lamppost, more for support than illumination" often applies to studies of ski jump fatalities. Statistics on ski jumping fatalities must be viewed with discernment, since the numbers are often grossly inflated by lumping the actual ski jumping sport with failed extreme skier stunts such as attempting to fly over a large crevasse or public highway.

## Historical Relevance

In the deep snow of the prehistoric world, transportation and hunting was aided by strapping sticks of wood to one's feet. Archaeological finds near today's border of Russia and Finland indicate that skis were used at least as early as 6000 BC. In those millenniums, leaping into the air with skis was probably inconceivable unless trying to scale a crevasse while being chased by a saber tooth tiger.

Ski jumping as a recognized pastime originated more than 200 years ago, with Norway attributed as the birthplace, but it hasn't been a curiosity isolated to Scandinavia. During the late 19th and early 20th century, northern Europeans streamed into the U.S. to work the mines, forests, and farmlands and brought their culture with them, which included their favorite sport of skiing, and in particular, ski jumping. There was a natural affinity for it, encouraged by a sense of family legacy. Perhaps fondness for a sport associated with bravado was to be expected in an era where everyday adult life was otherwise dominated by monotonous, exhausting, and yet hazardous nature of being a miner, logger, farmer, or housewife.

Whereas the first recorded ski jump (31 feet) is commonly credited to Norwegian Ole Rye in 1808, the first recognized North American competition of the transplanted sport was held in St. Paul, Minnesota as early as 1887, less than two decades after the first formal competition in Norway.

In the first 75 years of the 20th century, many American kids were playing baseball nearly every summer day on the streets or farm fields. In the winter, in any hilly neighborhood of the Northeast, upper Midwest, or Rocky Mountains blessed with snow, countless ski jumps (or bumps) of all sizes would appear.

The worldwide enthusiasm and cultural impact of ski jumping is evidenced by the sheer number of ski jumps that existed over the past century. As of November 2025, over 9000 ski jumps and 7000 ski jumping facilities in 48 countries have been catalogued by the massive and still growing Ski Jumping Hill Archive (33). It is neither complete nor will it ever include the countless smaller backyard bumps that communities had.

As a subset of this database, and an indication of ski jumping's continuing popularity, today there are still nearly 1600 active ski jumps worldwide. The historical popularity of ski jumping is also evident by the count of jumps either 'out of order' or 'destroyed' over the years. There are handfuls of ski jumps now under construction and more on the drawing board, pending adequate resources to proceed. Artificial surfacing (matting) has now been applied to nearly two thirds of them (1013), thus expanding the ski jumping season to whenever or wherever there is no snow.

On a country-by-country basis, a dozen countries have had more than 100 different ski jumping facilities, with Norway leading by far, Germany a distant second, and the U.S. in third. European and western Asian countries are also prominent. However, the extent of ski jumping diaspora is exponentially greater when noting not only Australia and New Zealand on the list, but Algeria, Chile, Lebanon, and Morocco?! Wow!

Regarding the 300+ U.S. ski jumping facilities, they existed across 28 states, with Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan having the highest count. In Michigan alone, 31 facilities were built over the years and nearly half of them were located in the Lower Peninsula, including the southerly cities of Brighton, Grand Rapids, Fenton, Oxford, and Detroit!

## Worldwide Heritage

Sampling 2024 - 2025 World Cup standings, the sport is presently dominated by Austria, Slovenia, Germany and Norway. The next tier includes Japan, Poland, Switzerland, Russia, and Finland. If judging by the top 30 World Cup standings for individuals, one finds an occasional jumper from France, Canada, or less frequently, from eastern European countries like Bulgaria or Estonia. Impressively, at the time of this writing, two U.S. jumpers finished in the top 30 for the 2024-2025 season, hailing from ski jumping organizations in Lake Placid and Chicago.

In terms of total Olympic ski jumping medal count, Norway leads the top six countries, as if they invented the sport. Oh yeah, they did. But Finland is right there in the 'Big Three', even though their medal harvesting has ceased since 2006.

![Olympic Ski Jumping Medal Count By Country (1924 – 2022)](resources/images/book/image34.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

The U.S. has but one Olympic medal in history, when Anders Haugen won bronze in the first Olympics in 1924. Ironically, it was not officially awarded until 1974 after a scoring mistake was finally uncovered. Anders Haugen even helped lead construction of his namesake Haugen Hill ski jump in Dillon, Colorado where he set more world records in 1919 and 1920 and performed jumping exhibitions into his late 50's.

Another impressive U.S. Olympic accomplishment was by Jeff Hastings in 1984, who recorded a 4th place on the Large hill and 9th place on the Normal hill. Over past Olympics, five other U.S. jumpers have cracked the top ten. So, the U.S. has achieved some measure of at least 2nd tier excellence on the world stage, but even that has not been sustainable.

It is widely accepted that Matti Nykaenen of Finland is the greatest ski jumper of all time. Admittedly, such GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) debates are endless depending on the athletes and sport involved. There have been many great ski jumpers and to name a few that includes Adam Malyk, Janne Ahonen (another Finn), Kamil Stoch, Jens Weisflog, and Ryoyu Kobayashi. But, Nykaenen was a dominating king of the hill. In a stunning 10 year stretch in the 80's, Matti accumulated 4 Olympic golds, 46 World Cup wins, 5 World Championship titles, and numerous Normal, Large, and Ski Flying hill distance records. In the two decades that followed, fellow countrymen Janne Ahonen and Toni Nieminen also won Olympic medals and World Cup championships, but their success was still overshadowed by the extent of Nykaenen's accomplishments.

![Matti Nykaenen – 1988 Calgary Olympics](resources/images/book/matti-nykaenen.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

As discussed in more detail later, today's V-style (skis held in a 'V' position while in flight) became standard after Nykaenen's peak success. His near perfect Daescher flight form garnered the most style points by the judging standard at that time. In actuality, Nykaenen was using a subtle hybrid approach. While holding skis parallel and close together to maintain the Daescher style, he also rotated both skis slightly to the right. Aerodynamically, it created a 'half-V' (or double forward slash on your keyboard), prescient to the aero benefits of future V-styles. And yet, his skis were parallel according to the Daescher judging standard of that time. It was a supreme example of ski jumping athletic genius, to whatever degree it was instinctive, or not.

Sadly, Nykaenen's personal life fell completely apart soon after he effectively retired from the sport in the early 90's. Even though it may be OK to admire or to emulate skills of a prominent person, Matti became a prime example of why idolatry of sports figures is a bad idea. In short, he tried to convert his celebrity status into becoming a pop singer, with limited success. Alcohol and violent impulses led to dozens of claims of spousal abuse and assaults on other persons stretching over six marriages, which culminated in two prison sentences and passing away at age 55 from pancreatitis and pneumonia.

Meanwhile, Finnish ski jumping has fallen from the top tier over the past 10 - 15 years. It is far from the prominence enjoyed during from the heydays from the 1980's to the 2000's. As a country, it still holds 3rd place for total number of Olympic medals. Despite several first class ski jumping training centers across the country where reservations are required to get hill time, Finnish jumpers complain that other top tier countries provide greater support to their jumpers. Some people point to a cross country skiing doping scandal that led to less sponsorships and financial support for Nordic skiing overall. A comprehensive youth recruitment strategy is also reportedly lacking, which sounds familiar in the U.S.

To what degree each of these factors contribute to the Finnish ski jumping malaise is not exactly known, but a situation all too familiar to me was evident while enjoying a brief family vacation in early January 2018 to Rovaniemi, Finland near the Arctic Circle. My daughter and I made an impromptu visit one winter afternoon shortly after dark to their impressive ski jumping complex. It follows the recipe of successful ski jumping clubs today, including a cascade of hill sizes, all season jumping, lights, and coaching for all skill levels from beginners to top international jumpers.

As I trudged up the side of the landing of the intermediate hill, it was déjà vu all over again as I came upon one middle aged man and two teenagers diligently preparing the inrun, dealing with a recent heavy snowfall. After eyeing me warily (a common Finnish trait) and perhaps being self conscious about his broken English, he instantly became congenial when I mentioned that I was a former ski jumper.

After he lamented that "Youngsters nowadays don't want to ski jump. Hill preparation is too much work for them. There are too many other distractions", he eagerly offered that "The hill is now ready. There are boots and skis that will fit you in the chalet." Whoa, I walked into that one. I didn't expect that he was going to call me out. After thanking him for such a kind offer, I slunk away, using the legitimate excuse that I hadn't jumped in 36 years and our family had evening plans (that did not include a hospital visit).

# The Merits of Ski Jumping

## Physical + Mental

What about the broader view of the sport? Even though the popularity of ski jumping in the U.S. has waned over recent decades, its merits are still compelling. This centuries old pastime fulfills the pursuit of an intense, high speed, anaerobic athletic challenge. In short, ski jumping demands unique physical prowess and mental fortitude. Yet, both a novice and an international champion can safely enjoy the thrills it offers. By these criteria, ski jumping is a top tier sport.

An aggregate of talents must be applied throughout the duration of what's called a ski jump that is much more than a jump, but has a prelude (inrun ramp), beginning (take-off), middle (flight), ending (landing) and postlude (transition to outrun). All of these jump segments must be mastered by an aggressive, but disciplined mindset that does not lose poise nor surrender to doubt, fear, or failure.

The excitement of ski jumping comes in multiple stages. Ski jumpers may be viewed as fear defying adrenaline junkies that have downhill skier instincts, embracing straightaway speed down the inrun ramp. Then, he must have a fearless commitment to make a gymnastic-like, cat quick leap precisely timed at take-off. Once in the air, he manages nearly weightless 'hang gliding-like' lift with subliminal neuromuscular coordination quickly adjusting to unpredictable air currents, before negotiating a feather soft landing. If the ski jumping 'pilot' masters all the subtleties of each ride stage, he will soar down the hill. Well, that's the goalposts.

Sure, if one can afford it, weightlessness can be simulated in 20 seconds of a parabolic airplane flight, just like astronauts practice. But the impression of speed is zilch. The lift and duration of a ski jumper's flight (2 – 8 seconds depending on the length of the ski jumper's flight), amidst variable conditions, is directly influenced by the athlete's skill. In a parabolic airplane flight, the conditions are created by the pilot while participant's influence on the result is minimized.

Sports that transcend the sole individual during competition are extra special. Successful team athletes allude to the joy of camaraderie while "climbing the mountain" together, celebrating, trusting, and picking up each other along the way. Sports that are more individually oriented, such as swimming, golf, or ski jumping, can also provide a similar level of fulfillment within a healthy club or team setting. In special circumstances, it is also evident across a community of competitors. Such was my experience with ski jumping.

## How Safe Is It?

OK, one may be attracted to a sport with thrills and skills, but how risky is ski jumping? With the growing sensitivity to safety in contemporary times, what is the actual (rather than widely believed), dangers of ski jumping? Unfortunately, potential new participants in ski jumping can be deterred, when in the interest of attracting audiences, ski jumping is erroneously portrayed as exceptionally dangerous. Sure, if one wants to toy with near death adrenaline levels, they might try wingsuit flying, but those risk-to-reward ratios are astronomically high. Such is just not the case with ski jumping.

What does the USA Nordic organization, an organization with a vested interest in the safety of its sport, say on the subject?

> "Ski jumping is a safe non-contact sport. Ski jumpers develop their jumping skills at their own pace. Each jumper starts out on the smallest hill with alpine skis, and progresses to the next larger hill when ready. Each skier progresses at a pace right for them with safety as the primary objective and with the input of experienced coaches who understand the importance of foundational skills necessary to keep jumping safe."

Within the overall sport of skiing, 2006 - 2008 FIS data concluded that injuries causing lost time for training or competitions on a per athlete basis was 15% - 35% less for ski jumping than that of alpine skiers and snowboarders.

A 2012 Consumer Product Safety Commission study revealed that for children ages 5 to 14 injuries for all types of skiing occurred at a rate of 2 per 100,000 participants. Yeah, two. All of the more common sports or activities (most of them involving some form of contact), such as football, basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer, and playground ranged from 51 (hockey) to 584 (football) injuries per 100,000 participants.

In studies of Winter Olympic injuries, less than 5% of ski jumpers incurred injuries, which is equivalent to curling! For all sports, 11% of participants were injured, with snowboard cross, freestyle skiing, bobsled, ice hockey, and short track being much higher than the average.

![Winter Olympic Injury Rates, By Sport](resources/images/book/image23.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

In a subsequent study of injury frequency for the 2914 athletes from 92 countries participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics at PyeongChang, South Korea, data was compiled for percentage of athletes losing time for training or competition to injury. The data was broken into three segments:

- Any injury that forced some lost time
- Injuries that forced time loss of greater than one day
- Injuries that forced time loss greater than one week

All injuries that prevented training or competing impacted less than 7% of athletes. Meanwhile, half pipe skiing, snowboard cross and ski cross, snowboard slopestyle, and aerials led the injury parade at 4X – 5X that frequency. A majority of injuries in those sports resulted in longer downtimes. Amongst the intermediate to high range for injuries were alpine skiing, bobsled, ice hockey, speed skating, and luge. Figure skating, cross country skiing, and freestyle mogul skiing occupied the low end of injury scale. Trailing the entire pack with the least amount (<1%) of injuries are those gun toting biathlon folks (thankfully) and nordic combined (which includes ski jumping as part of their regimen).

![Percentage of Athletes Losing Time to Injury in 2018 Olympic Winter Games](resources/images/book/image24.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

If such data is initially surprising, further inspection should make it intuitive. The impressive aerial skills of halfpipe skiers executing multiple twists, turns, and inversions followed by a mostly vertical descent and (hopefully) an upright landing onto an uneven hard snow terrain makes even superior athletes susceptible to injury.

Another relatively new sport, ski cross (formally organized in 1986 and adopted as an Olympic sport in 2010), has four competitors simultaneously racing side by side down a course full of bumps and turns. Their objective is to survive a progression of exciting, but aptly named, knockout rounds to win a championship. The likelihood of contact or injury inducing falls are supported by the data. Without being too poetic, contrast that with a single, well trained ski jumper soaring majestically through the air and touching down gently on an expertly profiled and smoothly groomed landing hill.

## The Agony of Defeat

Vinko Bogataj is the poster child for instilling alarm about ski jumping dangers. You almost certainly know of him, if you were born in the 90's or earlier. He's the poor chap from Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) whose cartwheel off the side of the inrun of a West German ski jump in March 1970 was immortalized as the Agony of Defeat at the beginning of every Wide World of Sports show before ABC cancelled the show in 1998.

A ski jumper of any skill level falling in the inrun is as rare as Halley's Comet swinging by Earth. The rest of Vinko's story is that he indeed suffered a concussion and broken ankle, but resumed training by June of that same year. Living in eastern Europe, he didn't know he was (in)famous until invited to a Wide World of Sports anniversary show in 1981 where Vinko received a standing ovation from a huge assembly of famous athletes, with Muhammad Ali himself requesting his autograph.

There is a combination of natural and trainable skills to reduce the possibility and/or severity of injury when a ski jumping fall occurs. Once it is obvious that a normal flight and landing is unrecoverable, the seriousness of the fall can usually be mitigated by piloting to a flat lying position and adhering to the hill surface as quickly as possible.

On the few times that I fell (usually 1 - 3 times per season), they were nearly all uneventful. I was fortunate to never hold a yard sale, nor did I personally witness a fall by another jumper that required immediate medical attention. But, as I tease others when alpine skiing or playing euchre, if you aren't occasionally falling or failing, you aren't really pushing the boundaries and learning. 'Going to the edge' certainly applies to achieving winning times in alpine downhill skiing, but to a lesser degree in the discipline of ski jumping.

**Yard sale** – slang for an epic, violent wipeout where a skier's equipment (skis, gloves, goggles, helmet, etc..) is scattered all over the landing hill.

The natural public fascination with hill size feeds the perception that ski jumping is a hazardous spectacle, competing for an occasional spotlight with the obscure and the extreme. Progressive in one sense, the bygone ABC's Wide World of Sports gave unprecedented attention to humans tempting fate with gravity by motorcycle jumping, high wire acts, or tower diving by men or donkey, but ski jumping didn't deserve to be lumped with those daredevil shows.

Make no mistake, at the largest (ski flying) hill class, the risk does increase without extensive training and established hill safety protocol. The attention to subtle wind and hill conditions on the big hills has grown more sophisticated over the years. Extra diligence is given to qualifying a ski jumper to ski fly, based on his or her track record and awareness of his mental make-up.

But, with a little internet searching, one can find Go-Pro videos of the usual, safe, and successful ski jumping ride. With a camera attached to a ski jumper's helmet, the videos do not do justice to the entire ski jumping experience, of course. They do provide a decent introduction to sight lines of a jumper, and a good impression as to how steady a ski jumper's flight (usually) is.

To cap the safety discussion, the age old quote "Most people use statistics like a drunk man uses a lamppost, more for support than illumination" often applies to studies of ski jump fatalities. Statistics on ski jumping fatalities must be viewed with discernment, since the numbers are often grossly inflated by lumping the actual ski jumping sport with failed extreme skier stunts such as attempting to fly over a large crevasse or public highway.

## Historical Relevance

In the deep snow of the prehistoric world, transportation and hunting was aided by strapping sticks of wood to one's feet. Archaeological finds near today's border of Russia and Finland indicate that skis were used at least as early as 6000 BC. In those millenniums, leaping into the air with skis was probably inconceivable unless trying to scale a crevasse while being chased by a saber tooth tiger.

Ski jumping as a recognized pastime originated more than 200 years ago, with Norway attributed as the birthplace, but it hasn't been a curiosity isolated to Scandinavia. During the late 19th and early 20th century, northern Europeans streamed into the U.S. to work the mines, forests, and farmlands and brought their culture with them, which included their favorite sport of skiing, and in particular, ski jumping. There was a natural affinity for it, encouraged by a sense of family legacy. Perhaps fondness for a sport associated with bravado was to be expected in an era where everyday adult life was otherwise dominated by monotonous, exhausting, and yet hazardous nature of being a miner, logger, farmer, or housewife.

Whereas the first recorded ski jump (31 feet) is commonly credited to Norwegian Ole Rye in 1808, the first recognized North American competition of the transplanted sport was held in St. Paul, Minnesota as early as 1887, less than two decades after the first formal competition in Norway.

In the first 75 years of the 20th century, many American kids were playing baseball nearly every summer day on the streets or farm fields. In the winter, in any hilly neighborhood of the Northeast, upper Midwest, or Rocky Mountains blessed with snow, countless ski jumps (or bumps) of all sizes would appear.

## The Worldwide Scope

The worldwide enthusiasm and cultural impact of ski jumping is evidenced by the sheer number of ski jumps that existed over the past century. As of November 2025, over 9000 ski jumps and 7000 ski jumping facilities in 48 countries have been catalogued by the massive and still growing Ski Jumping Hill Archive.

As a subset of this database, and an indication of ski jumping's continuing popularity, today there are still nearly 1600 active ski jumps worldwide. The historical popularity of ski jumping is also evident by the count of jumps either 'out of order' or 'destroyed' over the years. There are handfuls of ski jumps now under construction and more on the drawing board, pending adequate resources to proceed. Artificial surfacing (matting) has now been applied to nearly two thirds of them (1013), thus expanding the ski jumping season to whenever or wherever there is no snow.

On a country-by-country basis, a dozen countries have had more than 100 different ski jumping facilities, with Norway leading by far, Germany a distant second, and the U.S. in third. European and western Asian countries are also prominent. However, the extent of ski jumping diaspora is exponentially greater when noting not only Australia and New Zealand on the list, but Algeria, Chile, Lebanon, and Morocco?! Wow!

## Evolution of Style

The evolution of ski jumping technique and flight style over the past century has been remarkable. In the early 1900's, jumpers flew with arms windmilling for balance – a style that would be considered comical today. The Kongsberger technique, developed in Norway in the 1920's, introduced a more controlled forward lean with arms extended ahead.

The Daescher style, named for Swiss jumper Andreas Däscher, dominated from the late 1950's through the 1980's. It featured parallel skis held close together, with arms positioned at the hips and a moderate forward lean. This was the style I learned and practiced throughout my jumping career.

The V-style revolution began in 1985 when Swedish jumper Jan Boklöv discovered that spreading the ski tips into a V formation dramatically increased lift. Initially penalized by judges for unorthodox form, the technique proved so aerodynamically superior that it eventually became universal. Today, all competitive jumpers use variations of the V-style.

![Evolution of Ski Jumping Flight Styles](resources/images/book/image25.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

Equipment has evolved equally dramatically. The heavy hickory skis my father used have been replaced by lightweight carbon fiber composites. Binding systems allow precise adjustment of forward lean. Aerodynamic suits, carefully regulated to prevent unfair advantage, maximize lift while minimizing drag.

Hill design has also advanced significantly. Computer modeling now optimizes every aspect of jump construction – from inrun curvature to landing hill profile. Artificial surfaces allow year-round training. Wind screens and sophisticated monitoring systems improve safety and consistency.

These advances have pushed jumping distances to levels unimaginable in the 1970's. The current ski flying world record exceeds 250 meters (820 feet) – more than double what was achievable when I was competing.

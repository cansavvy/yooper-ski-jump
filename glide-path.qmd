# The Glide Path

## Glide Path

The winter of 1980 was the beginning of a glide path to my ski jumping retirement, although at the time I didn't think of it like that, nor did I want it to be. At age 19, I had now aged out of junior and into senior level competition. Except for the top flight jumpers with a sterling junior resume', this means starting in the lower level of senior jumpers, i.e. the 'B' class.

John Kusz and I were still able to represent the local club at a number of senior circuit meets. For me, that included Madison and Eau Claire in January, another go at Westby in early February, and then Suicide once again, while finishing up with the annual Wolverine meet in early March.

The highlight ride of the year was my second time on the 90m Westby. Due to his usual work constraints, Dad could not attend. John also had other commitments that weekend, so I was allowed to take the family car to southeastern Wisconsin as the solo Ironwood competitor. It was great to have the company of Ironwood native Dave Engstrom (the Green Hornet), who came up from his Rockford, Illinois home base.

This time I knew that I belonged on the large hill and rejected any passive thoughts, while pursuing a big hill ride. On the very last ride of the meet, I hit the longest jump ever (279 feet). The ride was effectively weightless as I stretched and peered completely over the front of my skis, just like Wally taught. Airtime was smooth and long, yet it still came to a conclusion too soon for my liking. I had finally created a Class 'A' flight angle and position. My body and skis were close to level, eliminating 'air plowing'. The Green Hornet congratulated me at the outrun. I was definitively competitive within the senior 'B' class. This is what ski jumping is all about. Now, we're starting to get somewhere.

As a postlude for that day, in the middle of the 270 mile winter trek home that night, the family car began to misfire and then died on a central Wisconsin highway in the middle of nowhere. No offense intended for calling central Wisconsin "nowhere". Before the era of cell phones and with no credit cards in hand, I was in a quandary. Thankfully, it was not fifteen minutes later that a congenial Wisconsin state trooper drove up and arranged for a tow to a local garage that was providentially open on a Sunday evening. They also had the required electrical part in stock. After the mechanic accepted Dad's verbal authorization over the wall phone, I was back on my way, having lost less than two hours. It was indeed a good day, from a glass ¾ full perspective.

## Fork in the Track

As should be evident if you read this far, I cherish the experiences of ski jumping. But in regard to achieving loftier dreams like national team and Olympics, they remained as dreams. Attending Gogebic Community College in 1979 and 1980 kept my academic costs manageable, but that only enabled me to keep jumping for two years after high school while aging out of junior class. And whether or not I had national level potential, it wasn't going to happen. With only a few jumps a week, little formal training or coaching, and hill preparation (see Appendix 2) being handled by a few jumpers and occasional selfless volunteers. But, that's OK. I received so much more out of ski jumping than I gave.

As I eyed what university to attend in 1981 and beyond, I was at a crossroads. Many other ski jumpers have faced this type of 'go big' or 'get on with life' dilemma. Do I continue ski jumping or launch headlong into an engineering career, or could I do both?

About that time, Northern Michigan University (NMU) launched an adjunct ski jumping team with their home facility (Suicide Hill complex) being one of my favorite sites. I tried every which way to rationalize attending NMU while continuing to ski jump. A shared workload in hill preparation that ensured a lot of jumping time was enticing in itself. The preferred scenario was to be affiliated with an organized team, even if only a walk-on. Ideally, it would be near the watchful eyes of a coaching staff. But at that time, there was no real engineering curriculum at Camp Northern (ah excuse me, NMU), as compared to Michigan Tech (MTU). I was born to be an engineer and that meant MTU.

By 1981 when I had become a full time student in Houghton for the ensuing four years, there was no practical means to maintain competitive recreational ski jumping skills, let alone progress to a higher level in the sport. It was still a privilege to compete on the intermediate size hills as a recreational ski jumper, but it was not meeting my expectations by languishing in the middle of the senior 'B' class riders.

As much as I wanted it, the timing for riding Copper Peak never worked out. After my shortened ankle breaking 1978 season, I was just then graduating to the larger than 60m hills, culminating in a few 90m experiences. But ski flying hills are another step up from the 90m hill class, especially in terms of higher airspeed and negative consequences of any critical mistakes during the ride. So, when I rushed over to the 1981 Copper Peak competition only as a spectator, it was indeed a wistful day to witness several of my Central Division peers riding the Peak, including Mike Shupien, Dave Edlund, and Mike Williams.

## Dynamic Duo

Sincere hats off to John Kusz and Dave Engstrom for managing personal and work lives, persisting over decades and performing at a high level of ski jumping, with weekends often being the only opportunity to ski. To qualify to ride a sky flying hill like Copper Peak, one has to have the demonstrated psychological make-up along with a considerable big hill resume', which John Kusz and Dave Engstrom diligently accumulated. Especially in the mid to late 70's, they committed to cross country travel to compete in national large hill meets.

In 1978, John and Dave were a ski jumping mature 29 and 34 years old, respectively, but still at the peak of their game and improving. As well documented (1), one lifetime achievement for them was riding Copper Peak, followed by a repeat performance in 1981. It was not only a special thrill for them, but for many of the local old-timers who were former ski jumpers. They had dreamed, conceived, and carried the torch for Copper Peak to be built. And wouldn't you know that there was the Green Hornet still riding Copper Peak as a forerunner in 1989 at age 45 and ski jumping internationally even into his 50's. Once again, kudos to true stalwarts like John and Dave who stayed actively involved and contributing to ski jumping for five or more decades. Wow!

The Green Hornet's characteristically elegant flight style was recognizable from a hundred yards away. I describe it as a hybrid between 1970's Daescher, as illustrated by the precisely close and parallel skis, while including remnants of the 1950's Windisch, which had arms wrapped snugly around the hips and a pronounced but not exaggerated jackknife. With head tilted back from the torso and eyes steadily peering to the hill bottom, Dave's knifed through the air with an unparalleled steadiness.

After I retired from ski jumping and embarked on a 40 year engineering career in downstate Michigan, sincere compliments to the Wolverine Ski Club for what they accomplished from the early 80's through the mid-90's. As documented by Supercynski (1), they refocused on revitalizing local junior jumping. A key step was John Kusz and six companions of the Wolverine Ski Club investing their time in being formally trained as ski jumping coaches. The commitment of many people resulted in a complement of smaller hills along the Wolverine ridge, including a 10m and 35m. That effort bore fruit. Over a 10 - 12 year period, local junior jumpers represented themselves and the club very well at ski jumping meets all over the Midwest and even nationwide (1). But, similar to my dozen year ski jumping experience, that mid-80's to mid-90's junior age class eventually grew up and had to move on to other phases of life, just as I did in the 1981 - 1982 timeframe.

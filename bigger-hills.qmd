# The Bigger Hills

## Pine Mountain

Pine Mountain is one of the largest ski jumping venues in North America, located in Iron Mountain, Michigan. The main jump is classified as a K90, capable of flights exceeding 300 feet. Pine Mountain has a rich history of hosting major ski jumping events and is one of the few remaining active large hills in the United States.

One day in late January 1978, riding the 90m Pine Mountain for the first time was a major leap forward. At 17, I was one of the youngest in our group of eight Ironwood area jumpers traveling to Iron Mountain that weekend. Even though Pine Mountain was only 20 miles from Bulldozer, it was my first time there. The energy and anticipation were palpable as we approached the imposing scaffold.

The inrun at Pine Mountain was a thing of beauty – a long, sweeping curve of ice that seemed to stretch forever toward the take-off. The starting gate was so high that the view from the top encompassed miles of the surrounding forest. As I pushed off for my first ride, the acceleration was unlike anything I had experienced. The speed built steadily, compressing me into the inrun crouch with increasing G-forces.

Then came the take-off, and for the first time, I truly understood what big hill ski jumping meant. The flight was long, smooth, and exhilarating. The landing hill seemed to unfurl below me in slow motion. When I finally touched down, I had traveled over 250 feet – longer than any jump I had ever made.

## Westby

Westby, Wisconsin was home to one of the premiere ski jumping facilities in the Midwest. The Snowflake Ski Club hosted tournaments that attracted top competitors from across the country. The main hill was classified as a K108, meaning flights could exceed 350 feet under ideal conditions.

My first experience at Westby came during a Central Division tournament in early 1978. The hill was imposing – larger than Pine Mountain and with a reputation for challenging conditions. The surrounding terrain created unpredictable wind patterns that could either help or hinder a jumper's flight.

The Westby community embraced ski jumping with a passion that was inspiring. Thousands of spectators would gather for major events, transforming the hillside into a sea of enthusiastic fans. The atmosphere was electric, unlike anything I had experienced at smaller venues.

Practice jumps at Westby required careful attention to wind conditions. The judges would halt jumping if gusts became too unpredictable, resuming only when conditions stabilized. This taught me patience and heightened my awareness of environmental factors that could affect a jump.

## Copper Peak

Copper Peak stands as America's only ski flying hill, located near Ironwood, Michigan. At 470 feet, it was the largest artificial ski jump in the world when completed in 1970. The facility includes a spectacular viewing tower and elevator that takes visitors to the top for panoramic views of three states and Canada.

For local jumpers, Copper Peak represented the ultimate challenge – and the ultimate dream. The hill was designed for ski flying, where athletes could achieve distances exceeding 500 feet under ideal conditions. Only the most experienced and accomplished jumpers were permitted to ride it, and qualification required a demonstrated track record on 90m hills.

I never had the opportunity to ride Copper Peak as a competitor, though it was always a goal. The timing never aligned with my skill development and the infrequent ski flying events held there. However, I had the privilege of watching world-class ski flyers compete at the Peak, witnessing the incredible spectacle of human flight.

The construction and maintenance of Copper Peak required enormous resources. The hill's southeast orientation made snow management challenging, and the facility saw periods of inactivity during the 1970s and 1980s. Despite these challenges, Copper Peak remained a source of tremendous local pride and a testament to the ambition of Upper Peninsula ski jumping enthusiasts.

## The 1978 Season

The 1978 season started promisingly but was cut short by injury. In early January, during a practice session at Wolverine, I landed awkwardly after a routine jump and felt immediate pain in my right ankle. X-rays confirmed a small fracture that would require several weeks of immobilization.

The timing was particularly frustrating because I had just begun to feel confident on larger hills. The injury forced me to miss several tournaments I had planned to attend, including opportunities to gain more experience at Pine Mountain and Westby.

Recovery was slow but steady. By late February, I was able to resume light training, and by mid-March, I took my first tentative jumps again. The season was essentially over, but I was determined to come back stronger the following year.

The injury taught me important lessons about the fine line between pushing limits and respecting physical constraints. It also reinforced the importance of proper technique in landing – the phase of a jump where most injuries occur.

## Growing Confidence

Despite the setback of 1978, the following seasons saw steady improvement in my jumping. Each experience on larger hills built confidence and technical proficiency. I learned to read wind conditions better, improved my take-off timing, and developed a more consistent flight position.

The transition from intermediate hills to 90m facilities was significant but manageable. The key was maintaining the fundamental techniques that worked on smaller hills while adapting to the increased speeds and longer flight times of bigger venues.

By 1979, I felt ready for the next challenge: qualifying for the Junior National Championships. This would require consistent performance across multiple tournaments and demonstrated competence on large hills. It was an ambitious goal, but one that seemed within reach given my progress.

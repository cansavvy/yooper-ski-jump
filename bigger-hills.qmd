# Bigger Hills

## Suicide Hill

A personal milestone in 1977 was riding the largest (70m) jump in the Ishpeming Suicide Hill complex for the first time. Listed at that time as a 70m, equivalent to the smaller of the two standard Olympic hill sizes, it represented a step up in hill size relative to Wolverine. (The largest jump of the complex grew in stature from being rated as a 70m in the 70's to now being labeled a K90, but more on that later). Located in a picturesque valley, more recently it has had jump sizes classified as 13m, 25m, 40m, 60m, and 90m. It also contained a cross country training center that constituted the U.P. Nordic Ski complex, which over the years has been affiliated with U.S. national ski team organizations.

Rich in ski jumping history, the Ishpeming / Negaunee area has hosted ski jumping competitions as far back as 1882, which influenced the location of the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame. Its inaugural tournament was held in 1925 and is one of the few remaining active ski jumps in the U.P. (The Ishpeming Suicide Hill is not to be confused with a smaller ski jump in New Boston, Massachusetts also named Suicide Hill that was destroyed by a storm in 1938.)

What might be viewed as a culturally insensitive name for the Ishpeming hill was coined in 1926 by a local reporter upon witnessing a skier suffer an injury, albeit non-fatal. He defended the name, quoted as saying "Sure, it's a good hill, but why not have a little color about it." That attitude reflected the early 1900's attitude to amplify ski jumping dangers to attract crowds (and readers), before the broader awareness and increased sensitivity to the tragedy of suicide was realized. Nevertheless, the name has stuck to this day.

Suicide Hill was an annual stop for the U.S. national team, who were respected, if not envied, for their flashy uniforms, equipment, and accomplished coaches. These rock stars of the ski jumping circuit warmed up before the meet by pushing a soccer ball around the outrun, before the U.S. became a competitive participant in World Cup soccer. They also practiced stationary leaps from the ground into flight position on top of a teammate's extended arms.

If you could competently ride Suicide, most ski jumps (outside of the ski flying hills) were within reach. As I sat with several senior Ironwood jumpers having breakfast at a local restaurant before heading out to ride Suicide for the first time, I couldn't help thinking that the rest of the people in the restaurant were going on to their safe, mundane day, while we would be flying through the air and ignoring risk to life and limb.

You still had to walk up a narrow scaffold while a jumper zoomed down the inrun a few feet away. And, you certainly didn't want to have so short a jump as to land on the ignominious 'cowpath'. That was the narrow snow packed trail that forms across the upper knoll where hill personnel and officials regularly walked to and from the other side of the landing. Of course, they didn't traverse across the knoll during jumps!

## The Character of Suicide

As compared to some other hills, Suicide seemed to consistently reward distance when a jump was well executed. The curvature of the inrun transition to the take-off table was tighter than most intermediate size hills, imparting more compression when approaching the take-off. Even today, the take-off table is designed with at least one degree more hang (11.5°) than most other hills. This aligns the flight trajectory more closely with the steep (36.5°) landing table. Headwinds on this larger hill were not greater than that of Wolverine. Spurious gusts were uncommon since the ski jumping complex resided in a natural bowl.

As with any walk in life, one can find humor during incidental, but unique circumstances. At one Suicide Hill meet in the 70's, the length of the outrun was extraordinarily short and slightly downward sloped. Despite hill design standards existing for inrun curvature, take-off angle, knoll shape, and landing hill slope (and having been more refined since then), the specifications for outrun profiles may not have been specific.

Jumpers ride through the transition of the steep landing (aka dip) onto the flat outrun with the highest speed of the entire ride. At most hills, there is adequate distance to slow down and ease to a stop with a combination of snowplow or other combination of parallel turns. Perhaps the outrun was intentionally shortened so a few more paying cars could be squeezed into the surrounding bowl. So, skiers could not absentmindedly glide to a casual stop. After completing the primary purpose of jumping, flying, and landing, one still had to alertly initiate a sliding stop immediately after the dip to avoid pounding into the snowbank at the end of the short outrun.

During the second day of this particular meet, the accumulated effect of skiers aggressively skidding to a stop turned the outrun surface into an ice rink. Amongst jumpers in queue at the top of the scaffold, we snickered when we witnessed any jumper ahead of us run out of outrun length and crash into the snowbank. It was ski jumping gallows humor at its best.

We also marveled at one jumper who adopted the unprecedented practice of starting to snowplow brake at high speed while still on the steepest part of the landing. It was a freakish athletic move predating Bo Jackson's famous horizontal run along an outfield wall in 1990. By the tail end of the meet, the hill management finally placed hay bales at the end of the outrun to cushion skiers with inadequate braking skills or attentiveness.

## Bulldozer

Bulldozer was a 55m jump carved out of the same ridge where Iron Mountain's famous 90m Pine Mountain jump stood. It was uncommon for a hill of Bulldozer's size in the upper Midwest to have a mostly natural inrun and landing, but apparently bulldozers could accomplish that.

I participated in two Bulldozer meets, including one in 1977. Without a scaffold, it appeared smaller than it was when standing next to its big Pine Mountain brother, but Bulldozer still rode like a larger intermediate sized hill, akin to Wolverine. I placed well in the meet, but a small, yet gratifying moment was being noticed by Ed Brisson, the previous head coach of the U.S. national team. A giant in the sport, he was involved in countless aspects of ski jumping over 80 years (yeah, 80), in addition to being head coach for the Central Division, and later, the U.S. National team. He led advancements in training coaches, hill preparation techniques, and safety.

My interaction with him was brief, but as we know, a lasting impression can happen in an instant. One of the practice days was plagued by crosswind gusts that can create havoc with a ski jumper's flight. Naturally hands-on, Coach Ed positioned himself on the knoll that blustery day, volunteering as the flagman to signal each jumper to proceed when he sensed that the wind had temporarily subsided.

On my best practice ride in terms of distance and smoothness, I noticed that I landed on the far right edge of the wide landing, barely a foot or so from the deep snowbank. I didn't think much of it at the time, but during my next walk up the hill, Coach Ed complimented me for handling the stiff gusts so well, while lightheartedly apologizing for flagging me into it. Since Ed was born a Yooper in Munising (which had its own history of ski jumping until the 1980's), his personable approach shouldn't have been surprising!

## Spotty Training

As youngsters, most of us at the Iron Bowl were not trained as formal athletes. Junior jumping in the Ironwood area in the early 70's was 'come one, come all' without tryouts, skill or physical requirements, or any obligation for individual training, except for showing up on Tuesday and Thursday evenings to prepare for meets on weekends. If you could safely ski down the hill a few times, you could try the smallest jump.

In my case, daily exercise came during walks to and from school and some physical play at recess. Casual athletics after school and on Saturdays was a given in my neighborhood. A gym class in school didn't really happen until my 4th grade year when the Ironwood School district finally hired a gym teacher.

On summer evenings, my friends and I played ball in the middle of our street, interrupted by an occasional car. A favorite baseball variation was called 'strikeout' that enabled only 3 kids to play, instead of the 10 or more recommended for a baseball game. As the name suggests, the focus was on batting and pitching; we were too lazy to field. The first day of early August football practice every year was also a rite of passage, signaling that 'real' school was just weeks away. On some winter evenings when weather allowed, instead of playing organized 'organized' hockey, we played pond hockey on the neighborhood ice rink, fashioned by the father of my schoolmate on the back of his property. There wasn't much 'organized' anything for most kids beyond the fall football and spring little league seasons.

When at home, as a young teenager, I did occasionally venture to perform push-ups and sit ups, but that petered out by junior high when discovering the many other activities that a teenager discovers. I don't remember any regular conditioning associated with ski jumping other than keeping in shape while preparing the hill for jumping.

Nonetheless, there was a connection between physical abilities and jumping results. During practice or school gym class whenever a standing vertical leap was measured, I had one of the better results. By teenage years, a 30 – 32 inch vertical leap put me in the top of the class and in the company of the best leapers in the school.

## Broken Ankle

Coming off a formative 1977 season, as a maturing sixteen year old, I was looking forward to 1978. Besides honing my skills on the regional tournament circuit, the Junior Nationals were to be held at my favorite hill, Suicide. I felt like I had home hill advantage, although a few hundred miles actually separated my home from Suicide. And, the Junior Olympic qualifying meet was also being held at Suicide, which should have increased my chances of qualifying for the Junior Olympics.

Well, the 1978 season was the shortest of my ski jumping career.

In basketball gym class during the first week of January, we were playing a pickup game when I came down awkwardly on the left ankle of a classmate. The result was a fractured ankle. Obviously, the injury ended my 1978 ski jumping and basketball seasons. This was just when the ski jumping season was getting underway! Oh, how I stewed about the missed opportunity.

Similar to most, if not all, setbacks that we encounter, I reflected on what would have happened, if only...

## Alpine Skiing & Broken Arm

In hindsight, I might have started trying to jump on bigger hills a year or two earlier. But, I remained on the small hills as a youngster for three reasons. The first was the absence of an intermediate size (40m+) hill during my elementary school years; the scaled down Wolverine could only be used intermittently.

The second reason was a broken arm in the 3rd grade that sidelined me for half of a winter season. In the pre-helmet era during a recreational alpine ski session, I collided with a tree on the edge of a Mt. Zion downhill trail. My father found me dazed and lying in the snow a few yards from the tree that I had wrapped my left arm around while my body kept on going. Dad rushed me to the Mt. Zion chalet and then to the Ironwood hospital. An arm in a cast on an energetic 10 year old getting the itch for skiing is not a welcome combination.

The third reason was my relatively small frame.

Typical of young athletes, I was often impatient and dreamed of accomplishing athletic feats beyond what was achievable at my maturity level. In retrospect, it would not have been safe to ride Suicide at the relatively small build I had at age 12 or 13. I simply didn't have the weight to achieve enough takeoff speed to clear the cowpath for the bigger hills.

## The Half Scaffold Stunt

As an example of my impatience during the era when the scaled down Wolverine had an under-designed take-off (and therefore could not be used for sanctioned meets), my schoolmate Todd and I had a hairbrained scheme to use only the top half of the 30m Iron Bowl scaffold. The bottom half of the Iron Bowl scaffold merged with the graded slope and rock outcropping of the natural inrun. In contrast, the top half of the scaffold was above ground and somewhat independent of the bottom half.

One evening, just as practice jumping was winding down at the Iron Bowl, we asked the adults for permission to try our stunt. One of them reluctantly approved it. So, we went up on the scaffold, as we usually did.

The idea was simply to proceed down the scaffold, but instead of continuing down the inrun to the take-off, we jumped off the scaffold about 10 feet from where the natural ground and scaffold converged. I still remember the sensation of going briefly airborne 15 or so feet above the ground and having to land on the side of the steep landing hill, somewhat expecting my skis to be ripped off my feet and ankles to explode. That is, landing at a nearly perpendicular angle to the slope. And, that is what nearly happened. I was actually OK, while schoolmate Todd took a minor tumble.

Some of the adults scolded us for our recklessness. To which we countered that 'we did get permission'. I don't think school chum Todd or I tried the stunt again. I actually don't recall much of Todd after that. I think his family moved from Ironwood sometime thereafter.

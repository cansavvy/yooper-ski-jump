    "text": "2.1 Foreword\nSki jumping holds a special place in the hearts of Yoopers and European heritage alike. As sketched here, the experiences of a junior class ski jumper in the 1970’s Ironwood, Michigan area should resonate with other ski jumpers, especially from that era. For those engaged in ski jumping after the 70’s era, may it trigger an ‘aha’ moment.\nFor my family, it provides an understanding and appreciation of our Dad (or Grampa or Great Grampa) whom they never really had the opportunity to get to know. Also, this account pays homage to the many that steadfastly and sacrificially supported this sport, especially during the 70’s and 80’s time period, led by those of the so-named ‘The Greatest Generation’, and their successors, the ‘Silent Generation’.\nIn the latter pages of this article, a few personal viewpoints are expressed on the evolution and future of ski jumping. Retiring from ski jumping over four decades ago provides a ‘Rip Van Winkle’ moment to compare and contrast ski jumping between the 50 years difference from the 1970’s to today. I also promote how this sport could be embraced on a wider scale. A few of the progressive U.S. ski jumping organizations that have adopted a promising, comprehensive model are mentioned.\nThis article does not pretend to be a comprehensive review of the sport of ski jumping. To color in the long history of ski jumping in the upper Midwest and specifically, the Gogebic Range of Michigan’s western Upper Peninsula, I’d point you to Charlie Supercynski’s Soaring With the Eagles as an engaging and thorough account. Besides my personal detail and anecdotes, some observations expressed here are similar to what Charlie captured. Even though he and I traveled different paths, we independently arrived at many of the same perspectives.",

    "text": "2.2 Sports Heroes\nAcross the span of sports in which I have participated, ski jumping was by far the most fulfilling. In the late 1990’s, nearly 20 years after my last jump, I would still dream (literally) about gliding through the air to the bottom of the jumping hill.\nI find that a majority of sports minded youngsters initially adopt their favorite sport, team, and athlete(s) around the ages of 9 or 10. As a left-handed baseball player as a youth, it was natural for me to try to emulate Norm Cash and Mickey Lolich. Around 1972, I debated with a wayward thinking cousin who adamantly claimed that Denny McLain was better than Mickey. Of course, McClain was just coming off two monster Cy Young years (31 wins in 1968 and 24 wins in 1969), but after that he only won another 21 games until the end of his career, handicapped by arm injuries and self-induced controversies. Meanwhile, the rubber armed Mickey was the 1968 three-game winning World Series hero who sustained success deep into the 70’s, thus settling that debate conclusively (in my mind, anyway). Yet, I digress.\nIn ski jumping, Jerry Martin was the hero of the time. He was at the pinnacle of his achievements in the early to mid-70’s. A personable and stylish jumper, Olympian in 1972 and 1976, and U.S. national ski jumping champion in 1971, 1973, and 1975, we witnessed his triumphs at the local Copper Peak ski flying hill. He sandwiched 1st places in 1973 and 1975 around a 2nd place in 1974, while extending the hill record each year. Jerry was in perfect Daescher flight form on his way to the 1973 U.S. National championship at Suicide Hill in Ishpeming, Michigan. It may be noted that goggles were not that popular and helmets were yet to be introduced to the sport.\n\n\n\nJerry Martin - 1973 U.S. National Ski Jumping Championships (Ishpeming)\n\n\n\nDaescher – the predominant ski jumping flight position or style from the late 1950’s until late-1980’s, illustrated by skis parallel and close together and the ski jumper’s torso bent slightly forward, with arms close or touching at the hips.\n\nWhat ‘knocked it out of the park’ for me was that prior to these achievements, in September 1971, Jerry permanently lost his right eye to an industrial accident. Amazingly, he overcame that deficit in depth perception, a critical ability in a high speed airborne sport covering long distances and changes of elevation over a sometimes difficult to distinguish terrain.",

    "section": "2.3 The Savonen Legacy",
    "text": "2.3 The Savonen Legacy\nOur dad, Wilbert (Willie) Savonen, was born and raised on a modest 40 acre dairy farm along Section 12 Road in Ironwood Township, along with brothers Toivo (Toyk) and Elmer and sister Helen. John (Juho) Savonen, wife Hilda, and their 6 year old son Onni (Willie’s father) emigrated to the U.S. from Finland in 1909 having already lost an infant and a toddler to disease, reflecting rampant mortality rates of the time. Fortunately, the family elected to escape their homeland before rising political turmoil escalated into civil war a few years later.\nFinnish was the primary language at the Ironwood Township home. It was not unusual in a 1st generation family in the U.S. that conversational English was not learned until reaching school age. So, in addition to an accent, there was a special flavor as to how words were pronounced. For Dad and his generation, it was natural for the ‘h’ to be silent in the ‘th’ combination, and a ‘j’ sounded like ‘y’, as it is today across broad swaths of Europe. As such, the pronunciation of the common given name Juho was ‘yoo hoe’. A sample Dad expression, when he intentionally embellished it, would be “Da troot ist dat skee yumping is a trill.”\nDad also had the tendency to speak a few malaprops, and some were not by design. When encountering stubbornly rusted bolts in a backyard repair job one day with his 11 year-old son (me) at his side, he impatiently directed “Go get the profane torch”. After a moment’s pause, we realized what had been said, and shared a hearty laugh. Actually, the word fit his moment of frustration.\nFor a small dairy farm to remain operational, repair ingenuity was a necessary skill for the Savonen boys. As a practical, hardscrabble solution, hay bale wire kept many of the farm implements functioning until a more thorough and durable repair was possible, even if the initial repair was neither aesthetic nor found in repair manuals (that often didn’t exist).\nWillie and older brother Toyk were always outside. The Savonen dairy farmhouse was perched on a rise overlooking idyllic Siemens Creek that bisected the property. They fished for brook trout and raised extra cash by trapping muskrat along its banks. Strenuous farm chores didn’t quell enthusiasm for sports when time permitted. Whenever possible, they rounded up the neighborhood boys to play ‘unorganized’ baseball. Even though the neighborhood consisted of miles between bustling farms and party line phones, youngsters gathered to play ball for hours without requiring adult or organizational oversight. The baseball field for them was the local gravel pit where bad hop ground balls were an inherent part of the game, and not shying away from the erratic bounce was a measure of toughness.\nIn the U.P. snow belt winter, skiing was the favored pastime. Alpine skiing (or downhill as it is often called) was ‘nice’, but the local alpine ski hill industry was small scale in the 1940’s and 50’s. Mount Zion ski hill was more than four miles from the Savonen homestead and lift tickets cost money. And even though both cross country skiing and ski jumping had already appeared in the 1924 France Olympics, local ski touring was a novelty and groomed trails were only a concept.\nAs Supercynski documents so well, ski jumping reigned as the preeminent local sport of the early 20th century. Ski jumps of all sizes and shapes could be found in so many of the hilly neighborhoods across the U.P. The Ironwood Ski Club formed in 1905 and built the 40m Curry Ski Hill ski jump. In the ski jumping community, Curry Hill was famous, with the ski jumping world record of 152 feet set in 1911 by Anders Haugen and extended to 169 feet in 1913 by Ragnar Omtvedt. Later that year, a severe wind storm knocked down its wooden scaffold. Rebuilt in 1923, its steep and slender steel girder construction relied on a web of guy wires to stay upright. Not to blithely assert that ski jump design standards were lax, but it was not unusual that ski jumping scaffolds met their demise in high winds, as was Curry Hill’s fate a second time during a 1930 storm.\n\n\n\nCurry Hill Ski Jump, Ironwood (1923)\n\n\nSo in 1935, the Ironwood Ski Club built the 50m Wolverine ski jump in Ironwood Township. It soon hosted one of the more prominent annual tournaments in the national ski jumping scene. Wolverine was built on a ridge enabling jumps in excess of 200 feet. However, the sideshow of pursuing the world distance record (which exceeded 300 feet by 1935) was now the domain of larger international hills. Nevertheless, Wolverine ski jumping tournaments were a spectacle, attracting patrons from across the upper Midwest region who wanted to see intrepid heroes of skill and daring soar (very) high through the air, if not tumble to the bottom.\n\n\n\nWolverine Ski Jump During 1940’s Tournaments\n\n\nAmong the ski jumping legends that Dad described to me, the exploits of Norwegian immigrant Torger Tokle were prominent. Tokle set the Wolverine hill record of 216 feet in 1942. National newspaper articles were calling him the “Babe Ruth of Skiing”. In a 4-year span (1939 – 1943) after migrating to the U.S., Tokle entered 44 tournaments and won 39 of them. Ultimately, Torger’s heroism was immortalized when he joined the U.S. Army and died in a 1945 World War II battle.\nAs indication of the Norwegian passion for skiing, all twenty of his siblings skied and two of his brothers (Kyrre and Art) eventually migrated to the U.S., becoming established ski jumpers and coaches in their own right. If marketing had been more sophisticated in that era, a prized pair of new jumping skis would have been advertised as Air Tokles, some 65 years prior to Air Jordans.\nSince Wolverine was less than a mile ‘as the pheasant flies’ from the Savonen farm, I imagine preteens Willie and Toyk enthralled while watching local ski jumping heroes like Ted Zoberski performing in their own backyard. In their teens and early twenties, Willie and Toyk regularly rode Wolverine, with Toyk competing in the official tournaments. At 5 foot 7 and 130 or so pounds, the Savonen boys were farm boy tough, wiry, and ‘quick as snot’, a physique that ironically served as the prototype for ski jumpers in the 21st century, rather than 1950.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWillie Savonen – Junior Jumper (circa 1946)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Savonen - Junior Jumper (1973)\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: Dad as a young teenager with his solid hickory skis and three grooves roughly carved into the bottoms. All purpose leather boots attached to skis with leather overstraps, metal front throws and cables. Attired with collared undershirt, Christmas sweater, baggy wool pants, and brimmed cap. Savonen dairy farm and gravel pit in background.\nRight: The author as a 12 year old with Northland composite five-groove plastic bottom jumping skis, although oversized for my stature. Nylon-leather jumping boots attached to skis with all metal cable throws, cables, and toeplates. Attired with winter sweater, stretch pants, soft knit cap, and choppers (Yooper for leather mittens with inner wool liners). Goggles and helmets were a thing of the future.\nAfter a day of jumping at Wolverine, they ski toured across the neighbors’ farm fields to get back to the lower lying Savonen dairy farm homestead. If the snow was ‘old’ and crusty, they glided effortlessly over the top of it with their heavy, stiff hickory skis.\nEven though traveling long distances in the dead of an upper Midwest winter in a 1930’s or 40’s automobile could be a precarious undertaking, the crowd size at Wolverine and other prominent ski jumping venues like Suicide Hill in Ishpeming routinely numbered in the thousands. Numerous vendors capitalized on the community event by selling culturally specific cuisine (with ketchup, of course!).\nAlas in 1963, the Wolverine ski hill scaffold was partially destroyed. Yeah, you guessed it. The culprit was a severe wind storm. A partially reconstructed inrun ramp enabled periodic use of a scaled down Wolverine during the 1965 - 1968 timeframe for practice and local or unsanctioned competitions.",

    "section": "2.4 Trailblazing Slab Rider",
    "text": "2.4 Trailblazing Slab Rider\nFast forward to the mid-1960’s, Willie and wife Shirley (Mom) are raising daughter (Wendy) and younger son (me). My first ski ride was on my father’s shoulders while he glided down the gentle 10 foot slope from our Ironwood Aurora Location house to the Richards’ yard next door. For that occasion or when going to Mt. Joy in Wakefield, Dad brushed on layers of pungent smelling shellac and rubbed paraffin wax of the appropriate color for that day’s snow conditions onto his three groove hickory jumping skis. Somewhere in the basement, he found and dusted off his low-cut leather jumping boots that hadn’t regularly seen snow in over a decade.\n\nIn contemporary terms, a ‘slab rider’ is someone that is part of a culture that creates customized vehicles known as slabs. In the broader skiing world, a ‘slab rider’ is a backcountry skier who may find themselves on top of an unstable slab of snow that could trigger an avalanche and lead to their untimely demise. But for local Yoopers, slab rider was a simpler, but less than complimentary moniker applied by non-skiers to all alpine skiers and their wooden slabs.\n\nThe initial love of slab riding for Wendy and myself got legs (and skis, of course) when our parents scrounged up money for the less expensive local alpine ski hills, such as Eagle Bluff (Hurley), Mt. Zion (Ironwood), and occasionally Whitecap (Upson). It was a treat when we were dropped off for three hours of Wednesday or Saturday night skiing at Big Powderhorn Mountain. The occasional splurge was a full Saturday’s worth of skiing.\nAt Powderhorn, the technique for using the bunny hill rope tow was not intuitive for this 7 year-old. After a few face plants and near tears, I eventually mastered it by gradually, not suddenly, tightening my grip on the moving rope. After bearing with snide comments by a rich bunny hill brat about my cheap and undersized ski equipment and persuaded by big sister Wendy waving gleefully and proudly from the chair lift overhead, I was motivated to graduate. When venturing to the top of 600 vertical foot Big Powderhorn Mountain, I realized that although the ski runs were much longer, most hill sections were not steeper nor more difficult than the steepest part of the bunny hill. It was an early lesson to maintain poise and confidence while graduating step by step to ever larger ski jumps.\nEven though it was an alpine ski area, we’d tend to ski off trail, dodge trees, and create small kickers (small jumps with an upward ramp) on the side of the main trail to practice rudimentary acrobatics. By the way, when propelled vertically by a kicker and landing a short distance further on flat ground, the impact is far greater than landing on any well designed ski jump hill.\nYet, the sibling standard for adventurous thrill seeking was pioneered by my sister (in her younger days). She boldly jumped off the Powderhorn chair lift one evening, as if it was a typical thing to do. As with some daredevil acts, the actual risk is often less than the risk perceived by non-participating observers. She jumped from a negotiable height into deep snow after removing her skis.\nLater, she trumped that adventure by somehow navigating her way to the very top of the monstrous Copper Peak ski flying hill scaffold while it was still in the finishing stages of construction. Chain link enclosures protecting the open-air walkways were not yet in place. I wouldn’t hazard to do that then or now, and I’m supposed to be the risk-taking ski jumper of the family.",

    "text": "2.5 Launch and Learn\nDad was curious as to whether his son would gravitate to ski jumping. So, on the rock outcropping 100 yards up the road from the Savonen Aurora Location home (where a local youngster might assume that aurora borealis was viewable in any community on a clear night), he shoveled a ski jump into existence. Two goldenrod weeds marked the jump take-off. For an 8 year old, it was Olympic size. With schoolmate Gary and myself the only riders in its brief history, the final hill record plateaued at 28 feet, or a bit short of the 1808 world record of 31 feet. With abandoned mining structures at the top of the hill precluding creation of a longer inrun and greater takeoff speeds, the hill record was secure. Nevertheless, the ‘trill’ of jumping was instilled.\n\nThroughout the U.P. in the early 1900’s, it was common that employees and their families lived in modest housing on hills in proximity to actual mining operations. The Aurora was one of a string of mines situated across the east-west Gogebic Range that briefly led the nation in iron ore production, peaking around 1930. By 1967, the last high-quality ore was railroaded out of the Gogebic Range and the mines were closed. Steep, miniature mountain ranges of rust-orange iron ore tailings and abandoned mining structures were left behind as an imposing and somber testament to the industriousness of the first half of the 1900’s.\n\nAcknowledging limitations of the scaled down Wolverine after the 1963 storm damage, the ardent Gogebic Range Ski Club (GRSC) committed to re-energizing local and youth ski jumping. The Caves provided the location. As named locally, the Caves are the east-west orientated land subsidence originating over the abandoned underground mines just 2 - 3 city blocks south of downtown Ironwood. There are no known open crevices, or caves per se, but Caves is vernacular for cave-in. It is a 1½ mile long by ¼ mile wide ravine with one side faced with 25 - 100 foot cliffs of dark rust iron rock. Decades before creative volunteerism established today’s Miner’s Memorial Heritage Park, the Caves were an unofficial local playground for snowmobiling, motorbiking, juvenile exploration, and multiple ski jumps.\nBy GRSC initiative in the late 60’s, the Caves location opposite the Ironwood Little League field became the venue for a new family of ski jumps. A few hundred yards west of the municipal landfill, the Iron Bowl, as it was named, had ski jumps ranging in size from 10m to 30m created on the Caves’ steep slopes. The ski club exploited the unnatural landscape by designing and grading a set of two ski jump landing hills out of the iron ore mining recesses.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 First Jump\nThe primary (and largest) ski jump was the 30m, where jumping distances in excess of 100 feet were readily achievable. The contours of the inrun and landing were designed by Supercynski in compliance with evolving jumping hill standards of the time, including a 10° downward sloping take-off table. The upper half of the inrun consisted of a 25 foot high scaffold of creosoted telephone poles and frugally obtained plank lumber. The scaffold merged into a graded rock slope transitioning to the take-off table. Construction of the Iron Bowl was completed in time for the inaugural meet in 1969.\nWith a new set of small jumping hills in place, GRSC launched a concerted effort to build the foundation of a ski jumping program, aided by local advertising. Though the quiet Finlander that he was, Dad still had ears to the ski jumping community.\nBy then in his late 30’s, Dad had fond memories of the defunct 30m Quarry Hill ski jump previously located in the Caves east of the Iron Bowl, where he competed in the early 1950’s. However, his favorite ski jump was the 35m Dynamite located just north of US2 and west of Section 12 Road on a bluff less than two miles from the Savonen family homestead.\nSo, one early winter Sunday in 1970, Dad took me to the Iron Bowl. There were about a dozen jumpers present, most of them using the largest (30m) hill. And that’s where we met Walter (Wally) Kusz, the chief orchestrator. We were enthusiastically welcomed, and after some discussion, I was coaxed to try riding the smaller landing hill.\nSnapping on my alpine skis on the knoll, I mustered the courage and slowly snowplow turned to start heading downhill. The hill surface was very smooth. As I steadily picked up speed, I didn’t expect that the slope would increase so rapidly and continuously. When I reached the steepest part of the downhill slope, and could finally see the bottom of the hill, it felt like I was going straight down. I hadn’t signed up for this.\nAfter another moment of descent, I bailed (sat down), and spun out. Sheepish though I was, Dad and others encouraged me to try again, while leaning forward into the downhill slope. On the second try, I did just that and then crouched low to the ground to stay upright through the transition (or dip) at the bottom of the landing hill. By 3rd or 4th try, I conquered the entire landing hill in a wobbly, but fully upright fashion. “I guess I’ll come back tomorrow”.\nHow time flies! Just 6 years later, I enjoyed my small part in helping prepare the Copper Peak landing hill, holding onto ropes while sidestepping and panking the hundreds of yards of the 40° sloped landing hill. Besides watching the tournament, my personal thrill as an early teen was the opportunity to ride the entire Copper Peak landing hill while crouched in an inrun tuck position the entire distance. It was speed to burn, baby and no radar in the area. I am sure that it was the fastest that I ever traveled on skis, and had to be well in excess of 70 mph considering that ski flyers reach the low to mid-60’s shooting down an inrun that is considerably shorter than the landing hill.\nAlongside the inrun of the 30m Iron Bowl jump and its scaffold, a 2-foot high snow bump was angled into the main landing hill, creating a 15m capable jump. Although the maximum achievable jumping distance was maybe 45 feet, beginners could experience the exhilaration of ski jumping and aerodynamic lift for the first time.",

With most alpine ski bindings of that era, the back of the ski boot rigidly attached to the ski by a cable wrapping around the heel. By removing the two cable guides on the sides of the ski closest to the heel, the heel was free to lift from the ski.\nAfter I used the modified alpine skis for a few months, Dad obtained a set of used, but actual jumping skis. Real jumping skis with wood-fiberglass composite core and five grooves on the plastic bottom surface! They were 50% wider, 70% longer, and at least 3 – 4 times heavier than my little alpine skis. If I was alpine skiing in the evening following a day of ski jumping, muscle memory made those alpine skis feel like toothpicks. Those dark blue Elan jumping skis provided an early 70’s luxury Cadillac smooth, muscle car Trans Am fast ride. In a drag race down the landing hill, anyone with jumping skis would surge past the alpine skier like any other car passing Dad’s ’59 Studebaker struggling up Birch Hill. At 255 cm long (8 foot 4 inches), the jumping skis were 6 - 8 inches oversized for my 5 foot and change height at the time, but I didn’t care.",

    "text": "3.3 Learning from Wally\nDuring ensuing weekends, a few of us youngsters were introduced to the actual sport of ski jumping. While Dad facilitated my interest and introduction to ski jumping, Wally Kusz was my first (and realistically only) ski jumping coach, with all due respect to many others who gave me an occasional tip or guidance over the years. With a distinct accent, as did nearly every first or second generation Yooper, he exuded an infectious enthusiasm. He also had a keen eye for identifying minor deviations from the fundamentals that he knew would yield success on any jumping hill, as he would emphasize:\n\n“It’s all in takeoff.”\n\n\n“Timing is crucial. Don’t jump too early or too late.”\n\n\n“In the inrun, keep your shin angle forward, back flat and level, and head up.”\n\n\n“When you jump, explode, keeping your chest down, and head level.”\n\n\n“Never, ever drop your head.”\n\n\n“When in the air, your body follows your head, just like a bird. So, always keep your head up and steady, while looking out over your skis and stretching for the bottom of the hill.”\n\nWally described the lift during the early stages of flight over the knoll as someone grabbing you by the back of your belt. Until then, my only reference of someone being grabbed and lifted by the back of the belt came from our 4th grade teacher. One day he escorted another misbehaving and then petrified classmate horizontally out of the classroom by the back of his belt, while he frantically hand surfed across classmates’ desks on the way to the principal’s office. Well, that was 1969 classroom discipline.\nIn a not so obvious parallel to hitting a baseball on the sweet spot of the bat barrel, a perfectly executed ski jump produces longer distances with seemingly minimal effort. The primary elements to achieving that ski jumping sweet spot is nailing the timing exactly with a quick and powerful take-off and transitioning quickly and smoothly to an optimal flight position. The fruits of all that are extra lift, and after clearing the knoll, an extended, almost weightless flight peering over skis and sighting beyond the hill bottom.",

    "text": "3.4 The Telemark Landing\nAfter a few months of riding the Iron Bowl, landing was not an issue. On the knoll and flatter landing slope of a small hill like the Iron Bowl, you could land in an upright alpine ski position and easily maintain balance. But, landing in proper ‘telemark’ style had to be learned for the sake of style points.\nA landing in telemark style reduces the chance of falling and mitigates impact damage to knees. One ski is advanced further than the other, and the jumper is in a squat-like position with knees flexed, like a shock absorber.\nThe telemark derives its name from the Telemark region in Norway, a birthplace of downhill as well as cross country skiing, and ski jumping. A telemark-like position is also used when a cross country skier slows down or negotiates a turn. To get technical, tele (Greek) means ‘far’ or ‘at a distance’.\n\n\n\nTelemark Landing Position",

    "text": "3.5 Learning the Hard Way\nIn my first November on the Iron Bowl, after a few weeks of practice, we had our first mini-meet for local jumpers. What distinguished a tournament day from practice was that you came dressed in your best clothing, like a fancy jacket and stretch pants.\nAnyway, for this special occasion, I was eager to show my stuff when family, friends, and club members were in attendance. I had earlier demonstrated decent competence on the 30m, so I started using the 30m inrun ramp.\nOveranxious to impress the crowd during one of my first three-ride tournament rounds, I misjudged my approach to the take-off. This is called jumping early. What happens is that most of the energy of the take-off is expended in the vertical direction, and not into a smooth horizontal trajectory. In skiing parlance, I popped. Popping will yield a brief but dramatic amount of time in the air, but not a lot of distance. And then, in the spirit of rapid learning, I made it worse.\nAs I came down from the apex of the pop, my center of gravity was not directly above my skis, so I had to scramble to center my body. In a fleeting moment of desperation, I concluded that the only way to land gracefully was to abandon one of my skis. I lifted my left leg and ski toward the armpit of my beautiful new, but now slashed, jacket. I landed upright, albeit like a flamingo, on one ski to a round of applause and a sprinkling of laughter. It was an embarrassing highlight captured in a newspaper feature photo, but a fellow jumper won the actual photo contest for that night. His picture captured an airborne leap in Daescher form with the local newspaper headline reading “Ride of a Lifetime”. Ah, but what a contrast between a nicely executed flight and an awkward landing.",

    "text": "3.6 Iron Bowl Characters\nWhen convening many winter evenings at the Iron Bowl hill, one becomes acquainted with the jumping styles and personalities of fellow jumpers. There was little formal coaching, but fellow jumpers tended to encourage each other. Most Iron Bowl jumpers in the early 70’s were accomplished high school or former athletes in other sports. In a sense, they were the unintentional forerunners of today’s sport culture awakening to the physical and mental benefits of youngsters participating in multiple sports across all four seasons.\nWhen I was in elementary school, most of my fellow local jumpers were in high school. It included football and wrestling stars and family legacy jumpers, with colorful personalities amongst all of them. The unique challenges and thrills of ski jumping attracted a diverse group.\nOne of our all sport high school stars was having a mediocre ski jumping evening that didn’t measure up to his own Type-A expectations, despite being unable to consistently give attention to the sport. At the bottom of the hill after what turned out to be his last jump of the night, he ripped off his skis and threw them like javelins twenty yards into the deep snow while expletives cascaded across the walls of the Iron Bowl ravine. We didn’t see him much after that.\nOne of the senior cats still jumping well past age 40 (after he started to ski jump in his 30’s) was Bob Shea. Although Bob wasn’t a ski jumping Olympian, he had the heart of a ski jumper and was part of the ski club soul for many years. As with all ski jumping hills, the Iron Bowl hill had a unique personality.\nBy the late 1970’s, when there were less than a handful of us still jumping locally (by then at Wolverine), Bob would periodically take a break from cross country skiing to watch a few of our jumps. After complementing one of my practice rides, he did not hesitate to plant the vision of going to the Olympics. Little did he know that that goal was already quietly embedded at the top of my list. But, it gave credence to my little vision when hearing someone else speak out loud to the belief that it was an achievable goal.",

    "text": "3.7 The Free Spirit\nAnother fellow jumper was athletic, but he wasn’t an athlete, meaning he couldn’t muster complete commitment to the sport. That didn’t lessen the enjoyment he got from recreational participation. Typical of most ski jumpers, he was part of a ski jumping family legacy.\nOn the side, he was reputedly active in small scale pot distribution. Whereas today, each new cannabis business opening of the now multi-billion-dollar Michigan industry is celebrated with mayoral ribbon cutting and a front page story in the local Daily Globe newspaper, in the 70’s it was necessarily underground and stigmatized. Anyway, this free spirit and purported cannabis distributor had a fun loving, outgoing personality.\nWhen putting on his skis at the top of the Iron Bowl scaffold one evening, he stepped into the ski toeplates as usual, but absentmindedly forgot to attach the cables to the back of his boots before launching down the inrun. OK, admittedly the Iron Bowl lights did not fully illuminate the top platform of the scaffold and he wasn’t the most detailed oriented guy, or maybe it was just an extra hazy day.\nIn retrospect, we watched an amazingly smooth inrun ride until he reached the end of jump. At that point, Kaos triumphed over Control. Normally, our Maxwell Smart had the habit of letting his skis spread apart just before take-off, abandoning the set inrun tracks. Perhaps it was his ‘drawing outside the lines’ metaphor for life.\nBut in this particular situation, he was fortunate. As he cleared the jump, a detached left ski dived to the left and a similarly free right ski dived to the right. In ski jumping slang, he was ‘rolling down the windows’ as he frantically windmilled his arms while flying past those of us standing on the knoll.\nThe center of the landing hill waited to receive him as he completed his 35 mph airwalk. Fortunately, due to good jumping hill design, our pal encountered a soft landing. He achieved an unofficial distance of 40 feet, although I think his skis flew further. He was uninjured, unfazed, and after trudging through the deep snow on both sides of the landing to retrieve his wayward skis, he was ready to go for another ride. We all hooted and laughed, including him.",

Helmets didn’t become standard ski jumping equipment until stipulated by the USSA in the mid-70’s. At that time, even ski flyers usually wore a soft cotton ski cap or beanie. Some ski flyers wore neither goggles nor any head covering.\n\n\n\nCanadian National Team Member Peter Wilson Soaring on Copper Peak\n\n\nPeter Wilson of the Canadian National Team garnered 4th place in 1973 on the huge ski flying Copper Peak hill. As captured above, he approaches his landing without compromising style.\nHowever, by the late 70’s, anyone expecting to compete in a USSA sanctioned meet had to wear a helmet. The first editions of ski jumping helmets were not stylish. The available soft plastic cap resembled an early 1900’s bathing cap adorned with colorful soft foam rectangular ridges. For that brief period, it could be embarrassing to a style conscious teen, but we were all in the same boat probably thinking, but not saying “Hey, you’re a circus clown, too.”\nThankfully, just a couple of years later, the equipment standard had graduated to a classical hard outer shell ‘sphere’, akin to what contact and automotive sports had been using for years. With that type of helmet and goggles in place, I felt very safe in my own little world, regardless of the size of the hill or others around me.",

In the ‘woulda’ category, I woulda been the 5th grade champion, too, but I took the wrong side of the last gate in the slalom run.\nTheron Peterson, the veteran Ironwood High coach of alpine skiing and several other sports, urged me to join the alpine team. I was honored, but I regrettably felt it was necessary to decline. During the compressed winter season, I didn’t know how I could do justice to both ski sports and for that matter, how my parents could absorb the additional cost of a second sport. Nevertheless, periodic recreational alpine skiing provided valuable cross training that benefitted ski jumping balance and agility.\nAs mentioned by Supercynski, a limited number of years remained for continued use of the Iron Bowl, since the Ironwood municipal authority was clamoring for more landfill space in the Caves property that they controlled. And even more problematically, with years passing since the underground mines were abandoned, the steadily rising water table would eventually peek above ground in the bottom of the Caves ravine.",

    "text": "4.1 Wolverine Regenerated\nDuring the 70’s and 80’s, the upper Midwest ski jumping tournament circuit was distributed across the western U.P., southern half of Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota, and northern Illinois. Until the late 70’s, the Gogebic Range Ski Club had a nucleus of ski jumpers who maintained the local ski jump, trained, and traveled together nearly every weekend to a Midwest tournament from the first full week of January through the middle of March. Most of the intermediate to large hills comprising that circuit are mapped below.\nMost of us had our own favorite hill(s), for various reasons. Perhaps it was the air currents on a particular hill, the detailed attention that the local club applied to hill preparation, the efficiency meet registration (on-site in this era), or the ease in which to traverse the snow paths up the hill and scaffold. On each weekend, there were usually two or more senior level tournaments simultaneously occurring on intermediate and large hills somewhere in the Midwest circuit. A USSA coordinated schedule enabled ski clubs to reserve their calendar spot year after year.\nAs I progressed through a relatively brief jumping career (1968 – 1981), I had the privilege of riding most, but not all, of the intermediate and large ski jumps in the region. However, due to meet cancellations or personal scheduling conflicts, I never had the chance to ride the ‘far south’ hills in northern Illinois, i.e. Rockford and Fox River Grove.\nIn the early 70’s, there were regular attempts at using the scaled down and repaired Wolverine scaffold, to fill the need for a hill bigger than the 30m Iron Bowl. The scaled down Wolverine in the mid-to-late 60’s was handicapped in that it was neither shaped to contemporary specifications nor consistent with its original design roots before a storm raised havoc. It was a hybrid of sorts. The partially salvaged inrun had a steep top half, followed by a sharp transition to a long, effectively flat takeoff table. It couldn’t be used for sanctioned competition although it still provided ‘big air’ ride for recreational purposes.\nIt took forethought, expertise, and determination by several stalwart members of the ‘Greatest Generation’ to get Wolverine rebuilt and back on stage in 1975. To bring Wolverine back to life, the ski jumping community was fortunate to have the unflinching commitment of a relatively small group, led by former jumpers, such as Wally Kusz, Bob Shea, Frank Pribyl, Charlie Supercynski and others that I apologize for failing to recall or being unaware. Others with little personal ski jumping history were also very active, committed supporters, such as Ernie Mattson, Ed Lakner, and Don Bull. Their altruistic support was extensive and inspiring.\nThe entire Wolverine jumping hill had to be re-contoured to the updated profile. Charlie Supercynski led the redesign and summarized the cost efficient material and labor. It took intensive effort by a modest size crew to get Wolverine back on its feet, including re-profiling the landing hill, reshaping a longer knoll, reworking the entire inrun slope by moving tons of earth, and constructing an entirely new scaffold on top of it. With the complete revision of Wolverine to prevailing 1975 hill standards, the region could once again point with pride to the historic 55m (some say 50m) ski jumping hill.\nNot to rehash its rich history prior to the 1975 rebuild, the new Wolverine established an invaluable bridge to prepare local ski jumpers for larger hills in addition to attracting national level competition. Before Wolverine was re-established in 1975, I was impressed how a few of the more experienced Ironwood jumpers, such as John and Mike Kusz, Bruce and Gene Harma, Russ Anderson and several others could venture to ride the large 90m hills like Pine Mountain or Westby, even though their preparation was limited primarily to the small 30m Iron Bowl, the scaled down Wolverine, or brief experiences on a few other intermediate size hills.",

The face of the bluff upon which Wolverine was built points directly into that wind (and did I mention toward the old Savonen homestead?). These natural headwinds provide jumpers with an airstream comparable to the next larger hill size. A steady headwind favors the aerodynamic lift of birds, kites, airplanes, and ski jumpers. On sunny days with a gentle breeze, it was not unusual to see a hawk or eagle hovering motionlessly high overhead.\nAfter executing an excellent take-off, a ski jumper transitioning into flight position was met by an airspeed differential (skier speed + opposing headwind velocity) that produced an exhilarating lift. With the lower and more lateral flight trajectory of the updated Wolverine hill design, a ski jumper had to take full advantage of the airlift to be successful.\n\n\n\nThe ‘New’ Wolverine in the Late 1970’s\n\n\nWith Wolverine’s reputation for big air and early season lake effect snowfall, it influenced the U.S. national ski jumping team to jump at the opportunity to be the first few to practice and compete on its updated version, prior to the arrival of the regular competitive season.",

Besides the U.S. national team and other regional riders, the tournament included seven local jumpers, five of which were in their last year or two of junior class age. Within the next three years, life’s circumstances dictated that all but John Kusz and I had effectively retired from the sport, and I couldn’t stay much longer (retiring by 1981).\n\n\n\n1975 – 76 Gogebic Range Ski Jumping Octet at Wolverine\n\n\nDuring practice on Wolverine, if taking full advantage of top gate inrun speed, you could enjoy long flights. If still 7 – 10 feet above the landing hill after clearing the knoll, you could peer over the skis to the bottom of the hill slope and outrun.\nOne of my most memorable rides occurred on one sunny, but otherwise unremarkable Saturday afternoon practice. Only three of us were riding one day, so our small crew alternated between being the jumper at the top of the inrun or standing at the knoll to flag the next jumper.\nAs I cleared the knoll during one flight, I knew it was a very good ride. Like other sports when an athlete is “in the zone”, time pauses and sound nearly ceases. All I could hear was a very gentle tap-tap as my ski tips lightly touched each other a couple of times during flight. And then, after what seemed like a long time, the ride had come to an end, and I landed softly as a feather.",

    "section": "4.4 The Challenges of Wolverine",
    "text": "4.4 The Challenges of Wolverine\nAn additional benefit of a northwest facing ski hill like Wolverine was that it was mostly shielded from direct winter sunlight which can soften or melt snow during mid-winter thaws, thus requiring extra effort to keep the inrun covered with snow or bring a premature end to the jumping season. The Wolverine inrun and landing were also protected from direct sunlight most of the winter day by trees lining its southwesterly side. (Less favorably, the Copper Peak ski flying hill faces southeast, which increases the challenge of keeping the massive inrun and landing hill prepared with adequate snow covering, especially if a mid-winter thaw occurs).\nThe first full winter (1976) of new Wolverine tested our stamina for hill preparation since snowfall totaled 265 inches, almost 100 inches greater than an average year on the Gogebic Range. By then, with the number of regularly active ski jumpers in the Ironwood area dwindled to a less than a dozen, it would have been impossible to keep both the Iron Bowl and Wolverine hills in shape. So, without lights on Wolverine at that juncture, jumping practice was limited to weekends.\nAs mentioned, although the early arriving and late departing snow in the Ironwood area would theoretically enable the longest jumping seasons in the Midwest (from mid-November until late March), the sheer effort for a small team to keep the hill in ski jumping shape throughout the winter did not afford more jumping uptime. More so, once the out-of-town ski jumping meet circuit commenced in early January, the number of weekends practicing on the home hill decreased further.\nOn an intermediate size hill, such as Wolverine, a solid day of practice amounted to anywhere from 8 - 12 rides. On a few rare days, the number of rides maxed out at greater than 15. Trudging up the landing hill and inrun would eventually be tiring, even for a young, fit athlete. In the late 70’s, when our ski jumping was largely limited to weekends, I personally totaled 175 – 225 jumps for an entire season, including out of town meets. In that regard, I envied some of my peers who had home hills with a rope tow or T-bar which facilitated 25 or more rides a day and a squadron of youth and adults to keep the jumping hill in shape, while generally dealing with less snowfall than Ironwood.\nMore so, a majority of the other ski jumping hills had lights, as did the 30m Iron Bowl before it had to be abandoned. We competed against clubs where zealous jumpers could accumulate more than 400 jumps a year. By the way, the FIS is not prone to sanction an international or ski flying hill meet nowadays if the facilities do not include a lift for the ski jumpers from the bottom of the hill to the top of the scaffold. C’mon, man. The hill climb was part of our cross training!",

It was common for a carnival like setting attracting huge paying audiences. No less famous than P.T. Barnum’s circus incorporated ski jumping into their early venues. A professional ski jumping association actually formed in 1929, but disbanded by 1934, not for lack of demand or paying audience, but for lack of available, uninjured jumpers.\nThrills and spills were promoted as the reason to come and see exhibition riders attempt somersaults and other amazing gymnastic feats with ski equipment and scaffold construction that would astound the most fearless jumper today. To attract audiences, they reinforced the stereotype of a dangerous sport.\n\n\n\nHenry Hansen In Mid-Flight Rotation\n\n\nHenry Hansen performing his signature somersault at some unknown location, sometime in the 1940’s.

He claimed to have experienced no serious injuries. Note the rickety super steep temporary scaffold construction with no side rails and at most a 4 foot wide inrun. And he did that with full size, heavy hickory jumping skis.\nEven if fear entered a ski exhibitionist’s mind, these macho daredevils of yesteryear couldn’t surrender to it amidst their ski jumping buddies and responsibilities to the paying public.\n\n\n\nEmpire Stadium Ski Jump, Vancouver (1954)\n\n\nTemporary inrun and landing hill scaffolds for competitive or exhibition jumping were built in population centers, such as Chicago’s Soldier Field, the Hollywood Bowl, the LA Coliseum, and even a few indoor venues, like New York’s Madison Square Garden.

    "text": "4.6 Diamond in the Rough\nIn addition to jumping competitions, acrobatic exhibitions were performed on these hastily constructed jumps. Four ski jumpers from Ironwood contributed to at least one Soldier Field exhibition by performing the ‘diamond’ formation. The ‘diamond’ formation involved four ski jumpers proceeding simultaneously down the inrun and through the air. The formation consisted of a lead skier traveling down the center of the inrun track like usual, followed immediately by two side by side (wingmen) skiers, and trailed by a fourth person.\nThe possibility of a mishap multiplied if the wingmen came too close to the inrun walls or collided with each other. Since both wingmen had one ski riding in rough snow outside of the established inrun track, it would be an uncomfortable approach to the take-off. Being less than a foot apart at take-off, the wingmen had to ensure that their ensuing flights did not converge, but diverged. Of course, if any of the first three riders fell, the fourth and last jumper could be joining a pileup.\nOne fine day immediately following the conclusion of a Wolverine meet in 1976, someone had the wild hair idea that we should enter carnival mode and recreate the diamond stunt. For our formation, I was nominated as the lead rider which is the easiest job (if you didn’t fall). Before launching down the inrun, my cohorts apprehensively emphasized to me to stay crouched after landing to maintain speed and avoid being caught from behind.\nAnd away we went. There were no collisions, but since I was the lead rider, I couldn’t see what was transpiring behind me. By the time I had landed and arrived at the outrun to peek behind, I saw a splintered diamond far behind. One wingman had spun out, but the tail rider was able to sidestep him. It wasn’t a professional exhibition and would have needed more practice and coordination to resemble what local ski jumping stuntmen performed 40 years earlier in front of a huge Chicago crowd. And to think that the USAF Thunderbird pilots keep four jets within 18 inches of each other in their diamond at the speed of sound! Our attempt at a diamond was fun. We never tried that again.",

After the formal competition concludes, some tournaments offer jumpers one more optional ride to compete for long-standing jump honors where distance matters, but not style. Without concern for preserving style points, a more aggressive go-for-broke approach could be attempted, even though the longest jumps are generally accompanied with superior style.\nAfter completion of the formal meet, many jumpers are prone to forego the long-standing jump competition. They may want to get an early start on the Sunday evening trip home, especially if they were not in the running for awards from the formal competition. And, if they had no realistic expectation of cranking out an exceptionally long long-standing jump, it was time to put the skis away. But, with formal tournament tension dissipated, the better jumpers often enjoyed one more ‘free’ ride. Pragmatically, the long-standing jump competition also filled time while the official tournament results were being compiled.\nBy the usual rules of ski jumping and even in a long-standing competition, one cannot fall or touch snow with any body part. And, even if the longest standing jump of the day exceeds the existing hill record, it does not change the official hill record, since the record only applies to official tournament jumps.\nAt the completion of a Wolverine meet one Sunday afternoon in 1980, the organizers staged a long-standing competition. Being an average ‘B’ class senior jumper now that I had graduated from the junior class the prior year, it would be unusual for me to compete in the long-standing jump against the U.S. national team and other ‘A’ class riders. However, an unexpected loophole was created, stipulating that long-standing competitors could start from any gate of their choosing.\nWhen I got near the top of the scaffold and walked past the U.S. team members on my way to the top gate, they were incredulous. Kip Sundgaard, one of the U.S. national team jumpers, peered up from his lower gate and blurted “You’re crazy”. I accepted his statement as a badge of either courage, insanity, or both. Having always used the top gate during practice days at Wolverine and rarely threatening the absolute bottom of the landing hill, I thought nothing of it.\nWith the additional speed of a well-worn, icy inrun track at the end of a tournament and my good take-off, I catapulted over the knoll higher than ever before. There was acute awareness that this trip was exceeding normal fly zones. When Wally used to say stretch out over your skis and sight the bottom of the hill, I didn’t picture it coming up so quickly to meet me. Unaccustomed to the view, I prematurely backed out of flight position. The result was that I landed so much shorter than the initial trajectory offered. By landing far back on my heels, I spun out harmlessly, but disappointedly at the bottom.\nA top tier jumper accustomed with toying the extremes of landing hills would have exploited the trajectory, nailing a jump well beyond the hill record (albeit an unofficial distance as mentioned). What a missed opportunity for me! On my walk up the hill afterward, I was saluted by Bob Shea saying “You had so much height you looked like Checko.” Chester ‘Checko’ Kusz, brother of Wally, was a powerfully stocky and exceptionally accomplished jumper during the heyday of an earlier generation of Ironwood jumpers.",

    "text": "5.1 Suicide Hill\nA personal milestone in 1977 was riding the largest (70m) jump in the Ishpeming Suicide Hill complex for the first time. Listed at that time as a 70m, equivalent to the smaller of the two standard Olympic hill sizes, it represented a step up in hill size relative to Wolverine. (The largest jump of the complex grew in stature from being rated as a 70m in the 70’s to now being labeled a K90, but more on that later). Located in a picturesque valley, more recently it has had jump sizes classified as 13m, 25m, 40m, 60m, and 90m. It also contained a cross country training center that constituted the U.P. Nordic Ski complex, which over the years has been affiliated with U.S. national ski team organizations.\nRich in ski jumping history, the Ishpeming / Negaunee area has hosted ski jumping competitions as far back as 1882, which influenced the location of the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame. Its inaugural tournament was held in 1925 and is one of the few remaining active ski jumps in the U.P. (The Ishpeming Suicide Hill is not to be confused with a smaller ski jump in New Boston, Massachusetts also named Suicide Hill that was destroyed by a storm in 1938.)\nSuicide Hill was an annual stop for the U.S. national team, who were respected, if not envied, for their flashy uniforms, equipment, and accomplished coaches. These rock stars of the ski jumping circuit warmed up before the meet by pushing a soccer ball around the outrun, before the U.S. became a competitive participant in World Cup soccer. They also practiced stationary leaps from the ground into flight position on top of a teammate’s extended arms.\nIf you could competently ride Suicide, most ski jumps (outside of the ski flying hills) were within reach. As I sat with several senior Ironwood jumpers having breakfast at a local restaurant before heading out to ride Suicide for the first time, I couldn’t help thinking that the rest of the people in the restaurant were going on to their safe, mundane day, while we would be flying through the air and ignoring risk to life and limb.\nYou still had to walk up a narrow scaffold while a jumper zoomed down the inrun a few feet away. And, you certainly didn’t want to have so short a jump as to land on the ignominious ‘cowpath’. That was the narrow snow packed trail that forms across the upper knoll where hill personnel and officials regularly walked to and from the other side of the landing. Of course, they didn’t traverse across the knoll during jumps!",

He defended the name, quoted as saying “Sure, it’s a good hill, but why not have a little color about it.” That attitude reflected the early 1900’s attitude to amplify ski jumping dangers to attract crowds (and readers), before the broader awareness and increased sensitivity to the tragedy of suicide was realized. Nevertheless, the name has stuck to this day.",

    "section": "5.2 The Character of Suicide",
    "text": "5.2 The Character of Suicide\nAs compared to some other hills, Suicide seemed to consistently reward distance when a jump was well executed. The curvature of the inrun transition to the take-off table was tighter than most intermediate size hills, imparting more compression when approaching the take-off. Even today, the take-off table is designed with at least one degree more hang (11.5°) than most other hills. This aligns the flight trajectory more closely with the steep (36.5°) landing table. Headwinds on this larger hill were not greater than that of Wolverine. Spurious gusts were uncommon since the ski jumping complex resided in a natural bowl.\nAs with any walk in life, one can find humor during incidental, but unique circumstances. At one Suicide Hill meet in the 70’s, the length of the outrun was extraordinarily short and slightly downward sloped. Despite hill design standards existing for inrun curvature, take-off angle, knoll shape, and landing hill slope (and having been more refined since then), the specifications for outrun profiles may not have been specific.\nJumpers ride through the transition of the steep landing (aka dip) onto the flat outrun with the highest speed of the entire ride. At most hills, there is adequate distance to slow down and ease to a stop with a combination of snowplow or other combination of parallel turns. Perhaps the outrun was intentionally shortened so a few more paying cars could be squeezed into the surrounding bowl. So, skiers could not absentmindedly glide to a casual stop. After completing the primary purpose of jumping, flying, and landing, one still had to alertly initiate a sliding stop immediately after the dip to avoid pounding into the snowbank at the end of the short outrun.\nDuring the second day of this particular meet, the accumulated effect of skiers aggressively skidding to a stop turned the outrun surface into an ice rink. Amongst jumpers in queue at the top of the scaffold, we snickered when we witnessed any jumper ahead of us run out of outrun length and crash into the snowbank. It was ski jumping gallows humor at its best.\nWe also marveled at one jumper who adopted the unprecedented practice of starting to snowplow brake at high speed while still on the steepest part of the landing. It was a freakish athletic move predating Bo Jackson’s famous horizontal run along an outfield wall in 1990. By the tail end of the meet, the hill management finally placed hay bales at the end of the outrun to cushion skiers with inadequate braking skills or attentiveness.",

    "text": "5.3 Bulldozer\nBulldozer was a 55m jump carved out of the same ridge where Iron Mountain’s famous 90m Pine Mountain jump stood. It was uncommon for a hill of Bulldozer’s size in the upper Midwest to have a mostly natural inrun and landing, but apparently bulldozers could accomplish that.\nI participated in two Bulldozer meets, including one in 1977. Without a scaffold, it appeared smaller than it was when standing next to its big Pine Mountain brother, but Bulldozer still rode like a larger intermediate sized hill, akin to Wolverine. I placed well in the meet, but a small, yet gratifying moment was being noticed by Ed Brisson, the previous head coach of the U.S. national team. A giant in the sport, he was involved in countless aspects of ski jumping over 80 years (yeah, 80), in addition to being head coach for the Central Division, and later, the U.S. National team. He led advancements in training coaches, hill preparation techniques, and safety.\nMy interaction with him was brief, but as we know, a lasting impression can happen in an instant. One of the practice days was plagued by crosswind gusts that can create havoc with a ski jumper’s flight. Naturally hands-on, Coach Ed positioned himself on the knoll that blustery day, volunteering as the flagman to signal each jumper to proceed when he sensed that the wind had temporarily subsided.\nOn my best practice ride in terms of distance and smoothness, I noticed that I landed on the far right edge of the wide landing, barely a foot or so from the deep snowbank. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but during my next walk up the hill, Coach Ed complimented me for handling the stiff gusts so well, while lightheartedly apologizing for flagging me into it. Since Ed was born a Yooper in Munising (which had its own history of ski jumping until the 1980’s), his personable approach shouldn’t have been surprising!",

    "text": "5.4 Spotty Training\nAs youngsters, most of us at the Iron Bowl were not trained as formal athletes. Junior jumping in the Ironwood area in the early 70’s was ‘come one, come all’ without tryouts, skill or physical requirements, or any obligation for individual training, except for showing up on Tuesday and Thursday evenings to prepare for meets on weekends. If you could safely ski down the hill a few times, you could try the smallest jump.\nIn my case, daily exercise came during walks to and from school and some physical play at recess. Casual athletics after school and on Saturdays was a given in my neighborhood. A gym class in school didn’t really happen until my 4th grade year when the Ironwood School district finally hired a gym teacher.\nOn summer evenings, my friends and I played ball in the middle of our street, interrupted by an occasional car. A favorite baseball variation was called ‘strikeout’ that enabled only 3 kids to play, instead of the 10 or more recommended for a baseball game. As the name suggests, the focus was on batting and pitching; we were too lazy to field. The first day of early August football practice every year was also a rite of passage, signaling that ‘real’ school was just weeks away. On some winter evenings when weather allowed, instead of playing organized ‘organized’ hockey, we played pond hockey on the neighborhood ice rink, fashioned by the father of my schoolmate on the back of his property. There wasn’t much ‘organized’ anything for most kids beyond the fall football and spring little league seasons.\nWhen at home, as a young teenager, I did occasionally venture to perform push-ups and sit ups, but that petered out by junior high when discovering the many other activities that a teenager discovers. I don’t remember any regular conditioning associated with ski jumping other than keeping in shape while preparing the hill for jumping.\nNonetheless, there was a connection between physical abilities and jumping results. During practice or school gym class whenever a standing vertical leap was measured, I had one of the better results. By teenage years, a 30 – 32 inch vertical leap put me in the top of the class and in the company of the best leapers in the school.",

I felt like I had home hill advantage, although a few hundred miles actually separated my home from Suicide. And, the Junior Olympic qualifying meet was also being held at Suicide, which should have increased my chances of qualifying for the Junior Olympics.\nWell, the 1978 season was the shortest of my ski jumping career.\nIn basketball gym class during the first week of January, we were playing a pickup game when I came down awkwardly on the left ankle of a classmate. The result was a fractured ankle. Obviously, the injury ended my 1978 ski jumping and basketball seasons. This was just when the ski jumping season was getting underway!

    "text": "5.6 Alpine Skiing & Broken Arm\nIn hindsight, I might have started trying to jump on bigger hills a year or two earlier. But, I remained on the small hills as a youngster for three reasons. The first was the absence of an intermediate size (40m+) hill during my elementary school years; the scaled down Wolverine could only be used intermittently.\nThe second reason was a broken arm in the 3rd grade that sidelined me for half of a winter season. In the pre-helmet era during a recreational alpine ski session, I collided with a tree on the edge of a Mt. Zion downhill trail. My father found me dazed and lying in the snow a few yards from the tree that I had wrapped my left arm around while my body kept on going. Dad rushed me to the Mt. Zion chalet and then to the Ironwood hospital. An arm in a cast on an energetic 10 year old getting the itch for skiing is not a welcome combination.\nThe third reason was my relatively small frame.\nTypical of young athletes, I was often impatient and dreamed of accomplishing athletic feats beyond what was achievable at my maturity level. In retrospect, it would not have been safe to ride Suicide at the relatively small build I had at age 12 or 13. I simply didn’t have the weight to achieve enough takeoff speed to clear the cowpath for the bigger hills.",

The bottom half of the Iron Bowl scaffold merged with the graded slope and rock outcropping of the natural inrun. In contrast, the top half of the scaffold was above ground and somewhat independent of the bottom half.\nOne evening, just as practice jumping was winding down at the Iron Bowl, we asked the adults for permission to try our stunt. One of them reluctantly approved it. So, we went up on the scaffold, as we usually did.\nThe idea was simply to proceed down the scaffold, but instead of continuing down the inrun to the take-off, we jumped off the scaffold about 10 feet from where the natural ground and scaffold converged. I still remember the sensation of going briefly airborne 15 or so feet above the ground and having to land on the side of the steep landing hill, somewhat expecting my skis to be ripped off my feet and ankles to explode. That is, landing at a nearly perpendicular angle to the slope. And, that is what nearly happened. I was actually OK, while schoolmate Todd took a minor tumble.\nSome of the adults scolded us for our recklessness. To which we countered that ‘we did get permission’. I don’t think school chum Todd or I tried the stunt again. I actually don’t recall much of Todd after that. I think his family moved from Ironwood sometime thereafter.",

It included the summit experiences of riding two 90m hills (Westby and Pine Mountain), qualifying for the Junior Nationals at Squaw Valley, and riding to over 275 feet on a large hill.\nMy first 90m experience at Westby was in early February 1979. I had been gradually graduating to larger hills, starting with the 30m Iron Bowl, followed by the 55m Wolverine and 70m Suicide.\nThe small and intermediate size hills in Wisconsin provided good physical and mental preparation for the large hill, but the 90m Westby Snowflake was a much greater class of hill size, speed, and distance. The required step up in mental preparation is greater than that of the physical. A view of the sheer size of the hill can be intimidating upon arrival.\nEach ride was preceded by an extra long trudge up the left side of the landing hill, followed by the nearly as long walk up the inrun and scaffold. During the uphill walk, there is a dull roar as each jumper launches and flies past at 60 mph.\nOne aspect of the Westby hill design that tempers the visual magnitude of hill is that the inrun transition and take-off sections are part of the natural landscape. In that respect, it resembled the Iron Bowl inrun layout, albeit on a 4X scale. The size of the scaffold above ground is huge, but not as big as other large hills whose inruns consist entirely of an above ground scaffold, such as Pine Mountain and of course, Copper Peak.",

Preoccupied with getting to the top of the Westby scaffold, I didn’t really notice the red and green lamp system at the Westby take-off until I was approaching final queue. If it was an early vintage projection TV, it was only missing the blue lamp. This is the big leagues. I had to assume that whomever was handling the lamps was alert.\nDuring practice prior to the tournament, there was offered a choice in what inrun gate to start from. The elite national team riders started from one lower gate than the ‘Senior B’, Veteran, or less accomplished Junior class jumpers. Anyway, I followed the crowd to the higher gate, while harboring the irrational thought that I might outjump the hill.\nThe momentous time came when I was next in queue. I had a mental state of “Let’s get this over with”. And finally, the distant lamp turned green. Once in the track in my inrun position, it all felt familiar, but the ride to the take-off took a long, so very long time. It was déjà vu of my first full ride on the 30m Iron Bowl, but this was an eternity. As I accumulated speed down the inrun, I was not fearful, but tense and a bit detached. With the inrun transition past and the take-off table finally approaching, the classic involuntary “gulp of anxiety” happened for the first time in my life.\nWith pent up anxiety to ‘get it over with’, I had to resist the temptation to jump early, which is recipe for disaster on any ski jump and more so on a giant hill. Upon take-off, it was good to finally be in the air. Yeah, it was high. I was passive in my take-off, so I landed sooner and harder than expected, barely clearing the Westby cowpath. It was both exhilarating and embarrassing. I was determined to be more aggressive on my next ride.\nOn tournament day at a large hill, you may have time for only two or three practice rides in the morning, followed by three tournament rides in the afternoon. And depending on the meet format, the first of the three meet rides may only be a trial ride and not count toward meet results.\nThe remainder of the two day weekend went OK. I started to get the feel of a large hill and achieve some respectable flights in the 220 - 240 foot range. Nothing competitive on a 90m hill, but at least I belonged on the hill.",

While snapping on my skis for another practice ride, Jamie Gaboury, one of my age group peers from Duluth, called out “Craig, don’t crank your knees this time”. I acknowledged his well meaning advice with a guttural ‘yep’.\nA fundamental ski jumping no-no in flight is bending (or pulling up) your knees, especially on a big hill where mistakes are magnified. Bent knees can lead to skis tips dropping, air pressure getting on top, and a full forward somersault.\nIn flight during the previous ride, I was aware that I had bent my knees slightly and briefly, as I must have intuitively felt that I was starting to pitch forward (Wally would have pointed out that I dropped my head, too), but I recovered and got out of it.\nIn retrospect, I was so impressed that in the midst of a final queue, a fellow teenage competitor observed a detail of my ride and mentioned it to me out of genuine concern.\nJamie went on to have rich ski jumping career well into his 30’s that included ski jumping tours in Europe and riding Copper Peak. Not surprisingly, he was inducted into the St. Paul Ski Club Hall of Fame in recognition of his leadership on several fronts, such as being a driving force for getting artificial surfaces on their local hills.

    "text": "6.5 Pine Mountain\nBefore the Junior Nationals, John Kusz and I met up with Ironwood native Dave Engstrom (aka the Green Hornet so named for his uniquely colored jumping suit) for the 90m Pine Mountain international meet.\nBuilt in the 1930’s, it was (and arguably still is) the most famous North American ski jump with tournaments scheduled every year for mid-February, when weather is generally favorable for big hill jumping. The Pine Mountain hill record surpassed 300 feet by 1960 and stood at 371 feet in 1979. With numerous subsequent hill modifications to the landing and scaffold since 1979, the current Pine Mountain hill record, set in 2018, stands at 472 feet.\nThe opportunity to ride Pine Mountain had special meaning for me, more than the 90m Westby hill that we had ridden 3 weeks earlier. My first view of big hill ski jumping occurred when I was 8 years old and Dad and I went to spectate at the 1968 Pine Mountain tournament. We watched part of the meet halfway up the side of the humongous landing. The speed and ‘roar’ of the jumpers flying past was awesome. I couldn’t imagine how anyone could do that. It never occurred to me that I would.\nFast forward to 1979, and there I was. While walking up the 500+ steps of the Pine Mountain landing for a practice jump, I heard someone bellow “Craig, Craig”. It was Todd, my co-conspirator when we naively tried the half-scaffold Iron Bowl stunt 8 years prior. He and his family had moved from Ironwood to Iron Mountain in the mid-70’s and so we lost track of each other. As he ran over, he congratulated me for riding Pine Mountain, while asking if I remembered our jumping experiment. It was a brief, flattering reacquaintance. It would have been nice to reminisce further, but I had to trek up the scaffold and focus on what to do on my next ride, while fixing a mindset that I belonged on The Pine Mountain. I never saw Todd again.\n\n\n\nPine Mountain Scaffold (circa 1959)\n\n\nIn 1979, before multiple renovations in 2017 and 2020 introduced steel decking and a ceramic inrun track, the old ‘house’ at the top of the scaffold still existed. It provided a unique hill top experience for a jumper in queue. While protecting jumpers from the wind and limiting the view of the surrounding landscape, there was underlying tension somewhere between ‘Hey, there’s no fooling around here, buddy’ and ‘You’re in the cattle chute now, so there’s no turning back’. Virtually no one was talking.\nMy first (and only) Pine Mountain meet was indeed a thrill. Although Dad had to work on Saturday’s first meet day, he was able to be present for Sunday’s final meet day. I didn’t master the hill, but it didn’t conquer me, either. My rides were steady and in a respectable 240 - 250 foot range.\nBy then, it was simply fun to be steadily soaring through the air for 3 – 4 seconds. And to think that ski flyers setting world records today are in the air for more than 9 seconds! Pine Mountain was a lifetime experience at such speeds and heights, amongst world class jumpers. As I came to a breathless stop on the outrun after one particular ride, there stood one youngster asking for my autograph, which I was honored to oblige. I pretended that it was a normal occurrence for me. I am quite certain that its value has not appreciated, although there is only one!",

    "text": "6.6 Junior Nationals at Squaw Valley\nThe March 1979 Junior Nationals were held over two weekends at the Olympic village in Squaw Valley, California. Anchored around the Squaw Valley alpine resort and built for the 1960 Olympics, it was an intimate winter sports venue. We stayed at the former Olympic athlete dormitories. Prior to the Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Olympics, the 1960 Olympics were noteworthy for the underdog United States hockey team winning its first ever gold medal before the Soviets resumed domination for another 20 years.\nThe 1960 ski jumping gold medal on the 80m hill was won by Germany for the first time, with silver going to Finland. Those Olympics also marked the first time that the Daescher (parallel skis and much less bending at the hip) flight style became the standard. The Nordic combined ski jumping event was held on the neighboring 60m hill. Both jumps were all natural inruns, in scenic evergreen surroundings. After 1960, Olympic ski jumping was expanded to include both Normal (60m) and Large (90m) hill competitions.\n\n\n\nPapoose Olympic Ski Jumping Hills, Squaw Valley (1960)\n\n\nIn March 1979, Squaw Valley was hit with a blizzard the day before we arrived with the Central Division contingent from other Midwest clubs. (As a historical coincidence, snowstorms also delayed the opening ceremonies of the 1960 Olympics). So, the first order of business for us was to dig out the 60m Nordic Combined hill, preparing it for our Junior National meet. With more than two feet of fresh snow, it felt just like home on the range, Gogebic Range that is.\nThe next morning the hill was deemed ready for jumping, or so we thought. However, with a natural inrun, it wasn’t easy to pinpoint the exact location of the jump. Hold that thought.",

    "text": "6.7 Breaking Trail\nAfter the hill is prepared, the first rider has the responsibility and small honor to set the inrun track in the snow, i.e. break trail. It requires skill in establishing a straight track from inrun start to the take-off which is centered with the landing hill and skis held steadily at shoulder width. I am not sure how it happened, but the officials asked me to do it. Perhaps it was because I was one of the more senior competitors and known as a steady big hill rider. Or, maybe it was viewed as a reward, since I was a prominent helper when excavating the hill the day before. Or, maybe I was just standing in the wrong (or right) place at the time. Anyway, I said ‘sure’.\nPoised at the top of the inrun, my fellow Central Division teammate from Ely kept murmuring “We’re starting too high on the hill. We’re starting too high on the hill.” I didn’t know how to argue that point with officials whom I trusted were familiar with the hill. So, I was flagged to go and launched down the uncharted inrun. The new snow felt a little slow, but I made a nice straight track centered skillfully between the two markers placed at the take-off. Then, everything went awry.\nThe first problem appeared as soon as I cleared the knoll. I was in orbit, leaving behind the designed flight trajectory of the hill. We had started too high on the hill! I had as much height as riding the 90m Pine Mountain two weeks earlier, but this was only a 60m hill. Even though I hadn’t jumped with maximum power, my flight path was carrying me well past the bottom of the hill.\nThe second and more disturbing problem was that I was exiting stage left. I had centered the track between the prescribed markers at the take-off, but the markers had not been aligned between the inrun start and the center of the landing below. I was flying far left of the prepared landing hill, and this time it wasn’t caused by a stiff crosswind.\nAs I quickly scanned possible landing (or more appropriately crash) sites, I noticed a hill crew staff member far below scampering to safety as I plummeted directly toward him. He had been a half dozen feet off to the side of the landing, but that wasn’t far enough. He had concluded that the garden rake in his hand was no defense against this raptor descending upon him with 8 foot yellow talons.",

    "text": "6.8 Emergency Stall\nWhat a predicament. In normal situations, a ski jumper uses subtle positioning of hands like ailerons to guide flight direction. At great expense to style points in competition, more aggressive adjustments can be made with entire arms, even beyond ‘rolling down the windows’. In this circumstance, no amount of full body contortions was going to divert my flight back to the landing strip.\nExcept for airplane flight training or aerobatics, stall is what pilots call an undesirable event. Yet, in this situation, a forced emergency stall was the best recourse. By aggressively pulling back on body lean, bending sharply at the waist (aka jack knifing), and getting my legs and skis directly underneath my center of gravity, I mostly defeated forward velocity. Descending awkwardly from the sky, there was little I could do reduce vertical velocity since parachutes are not issued to ski jumpers.\nAs I was about to meet the ground, it was the first and only time that I closed my eyes. I crashed where some hill slope still remained, so the impact was not as traumatic as it could have been. More so, I landed in the fresh snowbank conveniently created during the previous day’s excavation. After one bounce and roll in the soft stuff, I came to an abrupt halt.\nFrom a flight that lifted off horizontally at 45 mph and descended the vertical height of a 60m landing hill, it was amazing. I was uninjured. As I collected myself and my equipment, hill staff rushed over to determine what medical assistance to provide (unnecessary as it was). However, I soon realized that one of my cherished, new Kneissl skis (just like those of Finnish jumping star Matti Nykaenen’s) had snapped near the tip. The consolation was a broken ski and not a broken bone. The trial and big error event forestalled the first practice that morning for everybody. The jump take-off was cut back and lowered substantially to bring it into conformance.",

    "text": "6.9 The Competition\nThankfully, the local ski club found a spare set of Fischer jumping skis for my use the rest of the week. I started practicing the next day. After 2 practice days, the first competitive event was held with team jumping consisting of three and four man teams from the Central, Eastern, and Rocky Mountain regions, respectively. My four man team placed 4th amongst the twelve teams, and although I didn’t do anything spectacular, my individual results were 10th best overall.\nMy second unique experience occurred during practice between the team jumping days and the two final days of individual jumping competitions. Since it was March, day time temperatures climbed to the high 40’s and low 50’s, before falling below freezing at night. On one of my morning practice jumps, I fell forward onto the icy landing hill. After sliding to a halt, I realized that my left forearm was sporting a six inch raspberry that I have to this day. During hill preparation in the middle of a warm day, the landing hill surface was finalized with skis sidestepping down the hill. The resulting small ridges form a nice human cheese grater as it freezes.\nI placed 17th overall during one of the two individual jumping competitions that culminated Junior Nationals week. I never did see the results for the second day, but it was most likely somewhere between 10th and 20th place. The individual winner did ultimately represent the U.S. at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. Nonetheless, my results were encouraging. The point separation between 5th place and 20th place was modest. I could further rationalize that I was using unfamiliar skis and was disrupted by two different falls.\nAs a sad postlude not so uncommon in recent decades, the 1979 Junior Nationals were one of the last times that the Squaw Valley ski jumps were used. They were demolished a few years later and the hillsides were converted to speed skiing and snowboarding. Eventually, an express ski lift was installed in that location.",

He also offered that USSA would pay for new skis. (We later found that to be unnecessary since the skis were still under warranty). When I got back home, I exchanged them at the U.P. retail outlet for jumping skis (yes, such stores used to exist) near Champion, MI (also home of the five time “All Around Best U.P. Fire Department”).\nThe second week at Squaw Valley was filled with instructional sessions and dry land training. The coaches were impressed with how I had one of the highest vertical leaps measured in the gym. Yes, I had heard that before.\nA welcome diversion was being able to go alpine skiing one day on Squaw Valley Mountain. For a Yooper who had never ventured beyond the upper Midwest until that trip, the week in general and that particular day, was a real treat. Whereas the maximum elevation change at U.P. alpine hills is a measly 650 feet, the 2700 foot elevation change from top to bottom of Squaw Valley was another scale. The picturesque view from the tram ride and the length of the ski runs were awesome. Even for a fit 18 year old, my leg muscles were burning when skiing without pause from top to bottom of the mountain. From blustery, cold, and icy conditions at the top to sunny, mid-50’s and soft snow at the bottom. Just as noticeable was that ski attire changed dramatically, as if by magic, from winter parkas, ski pants, and goggles at the mountain top to shorts and bikinis at the bottom.\nThus ended the apex year of my ski jumping career.",

John also had other commitments that weekend, so I was allowed to take the family car to southeastern Wisconsin as the solo Ironwood competitor. It was great to have the company of Ironwood native Dave Engstrom (the Green Hornet), who came up from his Rockford, Illinois home base.\nThis time I knew that I belonged on the Large hill and rejected any passive thoughts, while pursuing a big hill ride. On the very last ride of the meet, I hit the longest jump ever (279 feet). The ride was effectively weightless as I stretched and peered completely over the front of my skis, just like Wally taught. Airtime was smooth and long, yet it still came to a conclusion too soon for my liking. I had finally created a Class ‘A’ flight angle and position. My body and skis were close to level, eliminating ‘plowing’ through the air. The Green Hornet congratulated me at the outrun. I was definitively competitive within the senior ‘B’ class. This is what ski jumping is all about. Now, we’re starting to get somewhere.\n\n\n\nWestby WI Snowflake K108 Ski Jumping Hill\n\n\nAs the final experience of the day, in the middle of the 270 mile winter trek home that night, the family car began to misfire and then died on a central Wisconsin highway in the middle of nowhere. (No offense intended for calling central Wisconsin ‘nowhere’). Before the era of cell phones and no credit cards in hand, I was in a quandary. Thankfully, it was not fifteen minutes later that a congenial Wisconsin state trooper drove up and arranged for a tow to a local garage that was providentially open on a Sunday evening. They also had the required electrical part in stock. After the mechanic accepted Dad’s verbal authorization over the wall phone, I was back on my way, having lost less than two hours.

But in regard to achieving loftier dreams like national team and Olympics, they remained as dreams. Attending Gogebic Community College in 1979 and 1980 kept my academic costs manageable, but that only enabled me to keep jumping for two years after high school while aging out of junior class. And whether or not I had national level potential, it wasn’t going to happen with a few jumps a week, when the few of us still jumping weren’t shoveling out Wolverine, and no formal training or coaching.\nAs I eyed what university to attend in 1981 and beyond, I was at a crossroads. Many other ski jumpers have faced this type of ‘go big’ or ‘get on with life’ dilemma. Do I continue ski jumping or launch headlong into an engineering career, or could I do both?\nAbout that time, Northern Michigan University (NMU) launched an adjunct ski jumping team with their home facility (Suicide Hill complex) being one of my favorite sites. I tried every which way to rationalize attending NMU while continuing to ski jump. A shared workload in hill preparation that ensured a lot of jumping time was enticing in itself. The preferred scenario was to be affiliated with an organized team, even if only a walk-on. Ideally, it would be near the watchful eyes of a coaching staff. But at that time, there was no real engineering curriculum at Camp Northern (ah excuse me, NMU), as compared to Michigan Tech (MTU). I was born to be an engineer and that meant Michigan Tech (MTU).\nBy 1981 when I became a full time student in Houghton for the next four years, there was no practical means to maintain competitive recreational ski jumping skills, let alone progress to a higher level in the sport. It was still a privilege to compete on the intermediate size hills as a recreational ski jumper, but it was not meeting my expectations by languishing in the middle of the senior ‘B’ class riders.",

As well documented, one lifetime achievement for them was riding Copper Peak, followed by a repeat performance in 1981. It was not only a special thrill for them, but for many of the local old-timers who were former ski jumpers. They had dreamed, conceived, and carried the torch for Copper Peak to be built. And wouldn’t you know that there was the Green Hornet still riding Copper Peak as a forerunner in 1989 at age 45 and ski jumping internationally even into his 50’s. Once again, kudos to true stalwarts like John and Dave who stayed actively involved and contributing to ski jumping for five or more decades.

I describe it as a hybrid between 1970’s Daescher, as illustrated by the precisely close and parallel skis, while including remnants of the 1950’s Windisch, which had arms wrapped snugly around the hips and a pronounced but not exaggerated jackknife.

A key step was John Kusz and six companions of the Wolverine Ski Club investing their time in being formally trained as ski jumping coaches.

Over a 10 - 12 year period, local junior jumpers represented themselves and the club very well at ski jumping meets all over the Midwest and occasionally nationwide.

    "text": "8.1 Athletic and Mental Merits\nWhat about the broader view of the sport? Even though the popularity of ski jumping in the U.S. has waned over recent decades, its merits are still compelling. This centuries old pastime fulfills the pursuit of a high intensity, anaerobic athletic challenge. In short, ski jumping demands unique physical prowess and mental fortitude. Yet, both a novice and an international champion can safely enjoy the thrills it offers. By these means of classification, ski jumping is a top tier sport.\nThe thrill of ski jumping is multi-faceted. A ski jumper has to embrace straightaway speed down the inrun ramp, fearless commitment at take-off, unpredictable ‘hang gliding-like’ lift, and near weightlessness before a feather soft landing. If the ski jumping ‘pilot’ masters all the subtleties of efficient air flight in fluctuating winds and evolving snow conditions, he will soar down the hill. Well, that’s the goalposts.\nSure, if one can afford it, weightlessness can be simulated in 20 seconds of a parabolic airplane flight, just like astronauts practice. But, the lift and duration of a ski jumper’s flight (2 – 8 seconds depending on the length of the ski jumper’s flight), amidst variable conditions, is directly influenced by the athlete’s skill. In a parabolic airplane flight, the conditions are created by the pilot while participant’s influence on the result is minimized.\nProgress has been made, but the athleticism and biomechanics of an elite ski jumper defies full description. A powerful cat quick leap must be timed precisely, followed by transition into an aerodynamically efficient flight position that continuously and quickly adjusts to a sometimes cold, blustery, unpredictable environment. Ski jumpers may be viewed as fear defying adrenaline junkies that have downhill skier instincts, gymnastic agility at speeds up to 65 mph, and subliminal genius for neuromuscular coordination when handling air currents.\nThat aggregate of talents must be applied throughout the duration of what’s called a ski jump that is much more than a jump, but has a prelude (inrun ramp), beginning (take-off), middle (flight), ending (landing) and postlude (transition to outrun). All of these jump segments must be mastered by an aggressive, but disciplined mindset that does not lose poise nor surrender to doubt, fear, or failure.",

With the growing sensitivity to safety in contemporary times, what is the actual (rather than widely believed), dangers of ski jumping? Unfortunately, potential new participants in ski jumping can be deterred, when in the interest of attracting audiences, ski jumping is erroneously portrayed as exceptionally dangerous. Sure, if one wants to toy with near death adrenaline levels, they might try wingsuit flying, but those risk-to-reward ratios are astronomically high. Such is just not the case with ski jumping.\nWhat does the USA Nordic organization, an organization with a vested interest in the safety of its sport, say on the subject?\n\n“Ski jumping is a safe non-contact sport. Ski jumpers develop their jumping skills at their own pace. Each jumper starts out on the smallest hill with alpine skis, and progresses to the next larger hill when ready. Each skier progresses at a pace right for them with safety as the primary objective and with the input of experienced coaches who understand the importance of foundational skills necessary to keep jumping safe.”\n\nA 2012 Consumer Product Safety Commission study revealed that for children ages 5 to 14 injuries for all types of skiing occurred at a rate of 2 per 100,000 participants. Yeah, two. All of the more common sports or activities (most of them involving some form of contact), such as football, basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer, and playground ranged from 51 (hockey) to 584 (football) injuries per 100,000 participants.\nWithin the overall sport of skiing, 2006 - 2008 International Ski Federation (FIS) data concluded that injuries causing lost time for training or competitions on a per athlete basis was 15% - 35% less for ski jumping than that of alpine skiers and snowboarders.",

Data was compiled for percentage of athletes losing time for training or competition to injury.\nAll injuries that prevented training or competing impacted less than 7% of the ski jumping participants. That’s equivalent to curling! Meanwhile, half pipe skiing, snowboard cross and ski cross, snowboard slopestyle, and aerials led the injury parade at 4X – 5X that frequency. Moreover, a majority of injuries in those sports resulted in longer downtimes. Amongst the intermediate to high range for injuries were alpine skiing, bobsled, ice hockey, speed skating, and luge. Figure skating, cross country skiing, and freestyle mogul skiing occupied the low end of injury scale. Trailing the entire pack with the least amount (&lt;1%) of injuries are those gun toting biathlon folks (thankfully) and nordic combined (which includes ski jumping as part of their regimen).\nIf such data is surprising, further inspection should prove it to be intuitive. The impressive aerial skills of halfpipe skiers executing multiple twists, turns, and inversions followed by a mostly vertical descent and (hopefully) an upright landing onto an uneven hard snow terrain makes even superior athletes susceptible to injury.\nAnother relatively new sport, ski cross (formally organized in 1986 and adopted as an Olympic sport in 2010), has four competitors simultaneously racing side by side down a course full of bumps and turns. Their objective is to survive a progression of exciting, but aptly named, knockout rounds to win a championship. The likelihood of contact or injury inducing falls are supported by the data. Without being too poetic, contrast that with a single, well trained ski jumper soaring majestically through the air and touching down gently on an expertly profiled and smoothly groomed landing hill.",

    "text": "8.5 The Agony of Defeat\nVinko Bogataj is the poster child for instilling alarm about ski jumping dangers. You almost certainly know of him, if you were born in the 90’s or earlier. He’s the poor chap from Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) whose cartwheel off the side of the inrun of a West German ski jump in March 1970 was immortalized as the Agony of Defeat at the beginning of every Wide World of Sports show before ABC cancelled the show in 1998.\nA ski jumper of any skill level falling in the inrun is as rare as Halley’s Comet swinging by Earth. The rest of Vinko’s story is that he indeed suffered a concussion and broken ankle, but resumed training by June of that same year. Living in eastern Europe, he didn’t know he was (in)famous until invited to a Wide World of Sports anniversary show in 1981 where Vinko received a standing ovation from a huge assembly of famous athletes, with Muhammad Ali himself requesting his autograph.\nThere is a combination of natural and trainable skills to reduce the possibility and/or severity of injury when a ski jumping fall occurs. Once it is obvious that a normal flight and landing is unrecoverable, the seriousness of the fall can usually be mitigated by piloting to a flat lying position and adhering to the hill surface as quickly as possible.\nOn the few times that I fell (1 - 3 times per season), they were almost all uneventful. I was fortunate and never held a yard sale, nor did I personally witness a fall by any other jumper that required immediate medical attention. But, as I tease others when alpine skiing or playing euchre, if you aren’t occasionally falling or failing, you aren’t really pushing the boundaries and learning. ‘Going to the edge’ certainly applies to achieving winning times in alpine downhill skiing, but to a lesser degree in the discipline of ski jumping.\n\nYard sale – slang for an epic, violent wipeout where a skier’s equipment (skis, gloves, goggles, helmet, etc..) is scattered all over the landing hill.",

Archaeological finds near today’s border of Russia and Finland indicate that skis were used at least as early as 6000 BC. In those millenniums, leaping into the air with skis was probably inconceivable unless trying to scale a crevasse while chased by a saber tooth tiger.\nSki jumping as a recognized pastime originated more than 200 years ago, with Norway attributed as the birthplace, but it hasn’t been a curiosity isolated to Scandinavia. During the late 19th and early 20th century, northern Europeans streamed into the U.S. to work the mines, forests, and farmlands and brought their culture with them, which included their favorite sport of skiing, and in particular, ski jumping. There was a natural affinity for it, encouraged by a sense of family legacy. Perhaps fondness for a sport associated with bravado was to be expected in an era where everyday adult life was otherwise dominated by monotonous, exhausting, and yet hazardous nature of being a miner, logger, farmer, or housewife.\nWhereas the first recorded ski jump (31 feet) is commonly credited to Norwegian Ole Rye in 1808, the first recognized North American competition of the transplanted sport was held in St. Paul, Minnesota as early as 1887, less than two decades after the first formal competition in Norway.\nIn the first 75 years of the 20th century, many American kids were playing baseball nearly every summer day on the streets or farm fields. In the winter, in any hilly neighborhood of the Northeast, upper Midwest, or Rocky Mountains blessed with snow, countless ski jumps (or bumps) of all sizes would appear.",

As of November 2025, over 9000 ski jumps and 7000 ski jumping facilities have been catalogued by the massive and still growing Ski Jumping Hill Archive. It is undoubtedly neither complete nor will it ever include the countless smaller ‘backyard bumps’ that many communities used to have.\nFrom an historical account, over 9000 ski jumps and 5154 ski jumping facilities in 48 countries have been identified. The discrepancy in numbers is explained by the process of identifying ski jumps and/or facilities naturally occurs before the details are developed and entered into the archive.\nAs a subset of this database, and an indication of ski jumping’s continuing popularity, today there are still nearly 1600 active ski jumps worldwide. The historical popularity of ski jumping is also evident by the count of jumps either ‘out of order’ or ‘destroyed’ over the years. There are handfuls of ski jumps now under construction and more on the drawing board, pending adequate resources to proceed. Artificial surfacing has now been applied to nearly two thirds of them (1013), thus expanding the ski jumping season even when or where there is no snow.\nOn a country-by-country basis, a dozen countries have had more than 100 different ski jumping facilities, with Norway leading by far, Germany a distant second, and the U.S. in third. European and western Asian countries are also prominent. However, the extent of ski jumping diaspora is exponentially greater when noting not only Australia and New Zealand on the list, but Algeria, Chile, Lebanon, and Morocco! Wow.\nRegarding the 300+ U.S. ski jumping facilities, they existed across 28 states, with Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan having the highest count. In Michigan alone, 31 facilities were built over the years and nearly half of them were located in the Lower Peninsula, including the southerly cities of Brighton, Grand Rapids, Fenton, Oxford, and Detroit!",

When contrasting today with an era nearly 50 years ago, the fact is that the number of ski jumping clubs in the U.S. has decreased dramatically. From over 160 ski jumping sites nationwide not so long ago, there remains but approximately 30 ski jumping clubs in 12 states. Of those thirty, twelve are located in the Midwest. Minnesota, a historical hotbed of ski jumping and prominent contributor to the U.S. national teams, now officially lists only 4 clubs, down from a total of 21 in the late 20th century. Regrettably, two of the most prominent Central Division clubs, Duluth and Ely, that produced numerous Olympians in the 70’s and 80’s era, have closed their operations.\nHow can the trend of a shrinking ski jumping participation be reversed? A prime example of undying commitment to the sport is the Chicago (Norge Ski Club). In the early 2000’s, while safety conscious Ely Minnesota city officials discussed how to scrap the unused 70m Ely ski jumping scaffold, along came Norge Ski Club to purchase the tower for $1. They then arranged to dismantle and transport the scaffold the 540 miles to Fox River Grove on seventeen flat bed trucks and re-assemble it. Effectively, they salvaged the demise of one club for the improvement of another. Now, that’s commitment.\nToday, Norge is one of several ski jumping clubs that have adapted a comprehensive approach to advance the sport. It includes a jumping hill complex that provides facilities and coaching from the smallest beginner hill to a Normal hill. At Norge, an organized team of trained coaches offer to guide the earliest beginners to seasoned Olympic class jumpers. Within one complex, the jumper can graduate through sensible hill size steps of 5m, 10m, 22m, 47, and 72m.\nBesides the towns listed above, other ski jumping hills and hills have sprung up in central Wisconsin, such as Cameron, Minocqua, Oconomowoc, and Rome. So, there is hope for Midwest ski jumping.",

Benefiting from regional commitments, as well as major investments for several Olympics hosted in North America over the past few decades, the U.S. (and our sovereign Canadian neighbor) have a significant number of large hill facilities well distributed across the East, Midwest, and West regions.\nMore so, availability of large hills is not a prerequisite for the majority of ski jumping population to thoroughly enjoy the sport at recreational levels. From either an international competitive or regional recreational perspective, the answer should be a resolute ‘no’. It is not a limiting factor.\nOf the 200 largest ski jumps around the world, 20 are located in North America. With 10% of the 200 largest ski jumps, it argues that the high end of the ski jumping scale is covered, especially at the current level of participation in the U.S. and Canada. Of course, periodic investments for upgrades or maintenance are required for facilities as they age.\nCloser to home, the upper Midwest is amply equipped with Large, Giant, and Ski Flying hills. Four of the largest seven (and six of largest twenty) ski jumps in North America are in the upper Midwest (western half of the U.P., southern half of Wisconsin, northeastern Minnesota, and northern Illinois) and situated within 100 to 400 miles of each other, including Thunder Bay, Ontario.",

They have recognized the importance of a graduated set of small hills within the same complex (ex: Madison, Iola, Wisconsin Rapids, Coleraine, Cloquet, St. Paul, and Bloomington), in addition to using hills already integral to most existing large ski jumping hill complexes.",

And with some variation, following a predefined sequence is necessary for ensuring a lasting structure. From my peanut gallery perspective, a similar philosophy applies for growing the sport of ski jumping in the U.S. The general answer to the question is that a foundation is where it starts.\nIn North America, a broad foundation of youth and community involvement is arguably lagging. A clear priority should be given to building from the ground up, focusing on youth and small to intermediate size hills. For ski jumping to be re-established as an integral part of the sporting culture, a critical mass of communities and families must embrace it by supporting youth oriented facilities and programs. I have high admiration for the existing ski jumping clubs continuing to propagate this approach.\nHaving said that, an occasional festival, such as a Copper Peak ski flying event, can complement the greater, longer term objective. Yet, it can’t be the primary or sole path to resuscitate the sport on a national or even local basis. Even though I was an awestruck 8 year old witnessing Pine Mountain jumpers roaring by, it was inconceivable at that time to envision riding Pine Mountain some time later. If anything, I would have concluded that such an amazing exhibition on a massive hill, although incredible to watch, was entirely out of my reach.\nOn a personal note, only by a father’s passion and a ski club that built a progression of jumping hills did the aspiration of riding big hills emerge and become a reality for me. As a junior class jumper, I greatly appreciated and depended on the support of the local ski club. That support included the building and maintenance of the Iron Bowl and then Wolverine hill which fortunately coincided with my junior jumping stint. Underlying all of this was local ski jumping leadership with a vision.",

    "text": "9.5 The Copper Peak Story\nAlthough I was not directly exposed to it as a youngster, internal tension existed for decades within the Gogebic Range and Wolverine Ski Clubs as to the best strategy to advance the sport of ski jumping, both locally and regionally. For the top down argument, a prominent ski flying facility would raise broader visibility to this great sport, and if accompanied by a financial windfall generated by ticket sales and TV exposure, the trickle down effect would benefit the foundation. Unfortunately, it has not panned out that way.\nOnce Copper Peak was birthed, the sheer magnitude of effort required of the finite sized crew saddled (or honored) with the responsibility of preparing for and executing a ski flying tournament while simultaneously trying to grow a junior / local jumping organization was exhausting and unsustainable. It is truly amazing that amidst all of the attention required to try to make Copper Peak a success, many of those same individuals were directly involved in the Wolverine rebuild and ensuring successful Wolverine meets.\nThe awesome accomplishment of building the massive Copper Peak ski flying facility by 1969 was started decades earlier with a stretch dream of a venerable group of ski jumping diehards. But, for a number of well documented reasons, the operational vision has not yet been realized, stifled periodically by weather misfortune, and more so, a hodgepodge of financial and organizational complexities that either were not handled well and/or could not be entirely anticipated. Suffice to say that solid financial underpinning of favorable TV contracts and 50,000 walk-up attendances so typical in Europe was not going to occur right out of the gate for an admittedly niche U.S. sport, despite ski jumping’s regional legacy. Although the track history of Copper Peak does not match the vision for it yet, ski jumping enthusiasts should bristle when locals try to dump it into a coffin with a toe tag of ‘white elephant’. That is not to say that the path to success will be easy without paradigm shifts in thinking and continued management creativity.\nSince the last ski flying tournament in 1994, snowmobile hill climbing and extreme 400m uphill running races from bottom of the landing to the top of the scaffold have periodically complemented Copper Peak operations that have largely subsisted on fees for chair lift and elevator rides to sightsee at the top of the tower during warmer months.",

For those more deeply familiar with the historical footprint of ski jumping, it is but one example of commitment that endures to this day. In 1928, Henry Hall led the building of a 60m ski jump near Brighton. Before being destroyed in 1937, the hill record of 201 feet was set by Ironwood’s Ted Zoberski in 1936.\nAs a final longer cast, with artificial hills and lights, ski jumping venues shouldn’t have to be limited to states with a few months of often inconsistent snowfall. OK, ski jumping requires a wholly different type of venue than most sports. But, if hockey and its massive infrastructure can be transplanted and thrive in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa Bay, LA, and of all places, Las Vegas, is it really farfetched to envision ski jumping popularized in regions reflexively thought to be illogical ski jumping sites? In contrast to alpine skiing, the footprint of ski jumping is small and access to an entire mountain range is not required. As just one out of the box idea, creative use of the towering landfills around the country could be used as ski jumping locations. In any case, ski jumping should be introduced in broader regions of the country, supported by locals that are passionate about carrying this great sport forward.\nThe exciting heritage of ski jumping should continue to be preserved and built upon, while shedding the shallow, antiquated perception of ski jumping being a dangerous circus act.",

    "text": "10.5 Charles (Charlie) Supercynski\nA phenomenal multi-sport athlete as a youth and young man, Charlie translated that passion for sports into being a shepherd for ski jumping. Since the early 1960’s, Charlie has been the multi-purpose glue (dare I say Super-glue!) for advancement of ski jumping on the Gogebic Range. Always approachable and unassuming, he has filled so many roles over the years from behind the scenes niches not getting addressed to leading a supervisory board out front.\nAs a junior jumper, I enjoyed the sport while people like Charlie worked hard to bridge the gap between ski club organizations with sometimes confusing or competing objectives. Until I had classes with Charlie as professor at Gogebic Community College, I was only superficially aware of the technical skills he had applied to designing multiple ski jumps, including the Iron Bowl, the scaled down Wolverine, and the 1975 Wolverine overhaul. Through it all, Charlie has also been the unflinching flag bearer, ambassador, custodian, and documentarian for Ironwood ski jumping.",

    "text": "10.6 Uncle Toivo\nWillie and Toivo (Toyk) always alluded to inheriting an exceptional work ethic from their Grandpa John who had to be a fierce dynamo to establish a new homestead from scratch in the early 1900’s in a harsh winter region of a new country and little to no English skills. As a soft spoken adult, Toivo (my godfather) was an avid outdoorsman who parlayed that high energy and discipline into being an avid cross country and marathon runner (which in turn his son John excelled).\nHe raised five kids with wife Bertha and worked more than 30 years as a welder and then foreman for the Reserve Mining Co in Silver Bay, Minnesota. In his later years, he expended boundless energy as a founding member (and sometimes called the grandfather) of the 310 mile Superior Hiking Trail, cleared out of rugged forest wilderness along the north shore of Lake Superior that today stretches from Wisconsin south of Duluth to the Canadian border.",

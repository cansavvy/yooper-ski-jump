    "text": "2.1 Foreword\nSki jumping holds a special place in the hearts of Yoopers and European heritage alike. As sketched here, the experiences of a junior class ski jumper in the 1970’s Ironwood, Michigan area should resonate with other ski jumpers, especially from that era. For those engaged in ski jumping after the 70’s era, may it trigger an ‘aha’ moment.\nFor my family, it provides an understanding and appreciation of our Dad (or Grampa or Great Grampa) whom they never really had the opportunity to get to know. Also, this account pays homage to the many that steadfastly and sacrificially supported this sport, especially during the 70’s and 80’s time period, led by those of the so-named ‘The Greatest Generation’, and their successors, the ‘Silent Generation’.\nIn the latter pages of this article, a few personal viewpoints are expressed on the evolution and future of ski jumping. Retiring from ski jumping over four decades ago provides a ‘Rip Van Winkle’ moment to compare and contrast ski jumping for the 50 years difference between the 1970’s and today. I also promote how this sport could be embraced on a wider scale. A few of the progressive U.S. ski jumping organizations that have adopted a promising, comprehensive model are mentioned.\nThis memoir does not pretend to be a comprehensive review of the sport of ski jumping. To color in the long history of ski jumping in the upper Midwest and specifically, the Gogebic Range of Michigan’s western Upper Peninsula, I’d point you to Charlie Supercynski’s Soaring With the Eagles as an engaging and thorough account. Besides my personal detail and anecdotes, some perspectives expressed here are parallel to what Charlie captured, even though he and I traveled distinctly different paths.\nPast and present ski jumping generations are increasingly recognizing the value of creating archives and historical accounts of this wonderful sport. There are several books and electronic caches containing the history and culture of ski jumping that can be discovered with a bit of internet searching. Understandably, such publications usually focus on a particular region. Further appreciation of the long history of skiing can be gained by venturing to the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming.\nFor more personal perspectives, an outpouring of anecdotes and remembrances are being collected via the US Ski Jumping Story Project. Heartwarming insights and greater appreciation of what it takes to be a ski jumper are shared. It illuminates how much others have given to, or have gained from, the sport. Many others have participated in ski jumping longer than my relatively short (14 year) stint, so there must still be a treasure trove of stories waiting to be revealed.\nUnless otherwise noted or obvious in context, several words are used interchangeably, such as ski jumper, jumper, or skier and hill, jump, or ski jump.\nSeveral American cultural references from the 70’s and 80’s are also sprinkled into the text. For those not born during or before those decades, a follow-up with your favorite electronic device may arm you for your next trivia night.",

Surprisingly, not all Michiganders (not Michiganians!) know that a Yooper is someone born (or in a less pure definition, resides) in the Upper Peninsula (aka U.P.) of Michigan. Broad use of the word Yooper is not that ancient.

    "text": "2.2 Heroes of Yore\nAcross the span of sports in which I have participated, ski jumping was by far the most fulfilling. In the late 1990’s, nearly 20 years after my last jump, I would still literally dream about gliding through the air to the bottom of the jumping hill.\nI find that a majority of sports minded youngsters typically adopt their favorite sport, team, and athlete(s) between the ages 9 - 11. As a young left-handed baseball player, I tried to emulate Norm Cash and Mickey Lolich. I debated with a wayward thinking cousin who adamantly claimed that Denny McLain was better than Mickey. McClain was just coming off two monster Cy Young years (31 wins in 1968 and 24 wins in 1969), he only won another 21 games for the rest of his career, plagued by arm injuries and self-induced trouble. Meanwhile, the rubber armed Mickey was the 1968 three-game winning World Series hero who sustained success deep into the 70’s, thus settling that debate conclusively. But, I digress.\nIn ski jumping, Jerry Martin was the hero of the time. He was at the pinnacle of his achievements in the early to mid-70’s. A personable and stylish jumper, Olympian in 1972 and 1976, and U.S. national ski jumping champion in 1971, 1973, and 1975, we witnessed his triumphs at the local Copper Peak ski flying hill. He sandwiched 1st places in 1973 and 1975 around a 2nd place in 1974, while extending the hill record each year. On his way to the 1973 U.S. National championship at Suicide Hill in Ishpeming, Michigan, Jerry was in perfect Daescher flight form.\nWhat knocked it out of the park for me was that prior to these achievements, in September 1971, he permanently lost his right eye to an industrial accident. Amazingly, he overcame that deficit in depth perception, a critical ability in a high speed airborne sport covering long distances and changes of elevation over a sometimes difficult to distinguish terrain.\n\n\n\nJerry Martin - 1973 U.S. National Ski Jumping Champion\n\n\n\nDaescher – the predominant flight style from the late 1950’s until late-1980’s, illustrated by skis parallel and close together and the ski jumper’s torso bent slightly forward, with arms close or touching at the hips. It may also be noted that goggles were not popular and helmets were yet to be introduced to the sport.",

    "title": "2  Introduction",
    "section": "2.3 Section 12 Legacy",
    "text": "2.3 Section 12 Legacy\nOur dad, Wilbert (Willie) Savonen, was born and raised on a modest 40 acre dairy farm along Section 12 Road in Ironwood Township, along with brothers Toivo (Toyk) and Elmer and sister Helen. John (Juho) Savonen, wife Hilda, and their 6 year old son Onni (Willie’s father) emigrated to the U.S. from Finland in 1909 having already lost an infant and a toddler to disease, reflecting rampant mortality rates of the time. Fortunately, the family elected to escape their homeland before rising political turmoil escalated into civil war a few years later.\nFinnish was the primary language at the Ironwood Township home. It was not unusual in a first generation family in the U.S. that conversational English was not learned until reaching school age. So, in addition to an accent, there was a special flavor as to how words were pronounced. For Dad and his generation, it was natural for the ‘h’ to be silent in the ‘th’ combination, and a ‘j’ sounded like ‘y’, as it is today across broad swaths of Europe. As such, the pronunciation of the common given name Juho was ‘yoo hoe’. A sample Dad expression, when he intentionally embellished it, would be “Da troot ist dat skee yumping is a trill.”\nDad also had the tendency to speak a few malaprops, and some were not by design. When encountering stubbornly rusted bolts in a backyard repair job one day with his 11 year-old son (me) at his side, he impatiently directed “Go get the profane torch”. After a moment’s pause, we realized what had been said, and shared a hearty laugh. Actually, the word fit his moment of frustration.\nFor a small dairy farm to remain operational, repair ingenuity was a necessary skill for the Savonen boys. As a practical, hardscrabble solution, hay bale wire kept many of the farm implements functioning until a more thorough and durable repair was possible, even if the initial repair was neither aesthetic nor found in repair manuals (that often didn’t exist).\nWillie and older brother Toyk were always outside. The Savonen dairy farmhouse was perched on a rise overlooking idyllic Siemens Creek that bisected the property. They fished for brook trout and raised extra cash by trapping muskrat along its banks. Strenuous farm chores didn’t quell enthusiasm for sports when time permitted. Whenever possible, they rounded up the neighborhood boys to play ‘unorganized’ baseball. Even though the neighborhood consisted of miles between bustling farms and party line phones, youngsters gathered to play ball for hours without requiring adult presence or organizational oversight. The baseball field for them was the local gravel pit where bad hop ground balls were an inherent part of the game, and not shying away from the erratic bounce was a measure of toughness.\nIn the U.P. snow belt winter, skiing was the favored pastime. Alpine skiing (or downhill as it is often called) was ‘nice’, but the local alpine ski hill industry was small scale in the 40’s and 50’s. Mount Zion ski hill was more than four miles from the Savonen homestead and lift tickets cost money. And even though both cross country skiing and ski jumping had already appeared in the 1924 France Olympics, local ski touring was a novelty and groomed trails were only a concept.\nAs Supercynski documents so well, ski jumping reigned as the preeminent local sport of the early 20th century. Ski jumps of all sizes and shapes could be found in so many of the hilly neighborhoods across the U.P. The Ironwood Ski Club formed in 1905 and built the 40m Curry Ski Hill ski jump. In the ski jumping community, Curry Hill was famous, with the ski jumping world record of 152 feet set in 1911 by Anders Haugen and extended to 169 feet in 1913 by Ragnar Omtvedt. Later that year, a severe wind storm knocked down its wooden scaffold. Rebuilt in 1923, its steep and slender steel girder construction relied on a web of guy wires to stay upright. Not to blithely assert that ski jump design standards were lax, but it was not unusual that ski jumping scaffolds met their demise in high winds, as was Curry Hill’s fate a second time during a 1930 storm.\n\n\n\nCurry Hill Ski Jump, Ironwood (1923)\n\n\nSo in 1935, the Ironwood Ski Club built the 50m Wolverine ski jump in Ironwood Township. It soon hosted one of the more prominent annual tournaments in the national ski jumping scene. Wolverine was built on a ridge enabling jumps in excess of 200 feet. However, the sideshow of pursuing the world distance record (which exceeded 300 feet by 1935) was now the domain of larger international hills. Nevertheless, Wolverine ski jumping tournaments were a spectacle, attracting patrons from across the upper Midwest region who wanted to see intrepid heroes of skill and daring soar (very) high through the air, if not tumble to the bottom.\n\n\n\nWolverine Ski Jump During 1940’s Tournaments\n\n\nAmong the ski jumping legends that Dad described to me, the exploits of Norwegian immigrant Torger Tokle were prominent. Tokle set the Wolverine hill record of 216 feet in 1942. National newspaper articles were calling him the “Babe Ruth of Skiing”. In a 4-year span (1939 – 1943) after migrating to the U.S., Tokle entered 44 tournaments and won 39 of them. Ultimately, Torger’s heroism was immortalized when he joined the U.S. Army and died in a 1945 World War II battle.\nAs indication of the Norwegian passion for skiing, all twenty of his siblings skied and two of his brothers (Kyrre and Art) eventually migrated to the U.S., becoming established ski jumpers and coaches in their own right. If marketing had been more sophisticated in that era, a prized pair of new jumping skis would have been advertised as Air Tokles, some 65 years prior to Air Jordans.\nSince Wolverine was less than a mile as the pheasant flies from the Savonen farm, I imagine preteens Willie and Toyk enthralled while watching local ski jumping heroes like Ted Zoberski performing in their own backyard. In their teens and early twenties, Willie and Toyk regularly rode Wolverine, with Toyk competing in the official tournaments. At 5 foot 7 and 130 or so pounds, the Savonen boys were farm boy tough, wiry, and quick as snot, a physique that ironically served as the prototype for ski jumpers in the 21st century, rather than 1950.\n\n\n\nTeenaged Willie Savonen Action Pose\n\n\nAfter a day of jumping at Wolverine, they ski toured across the neighbors’ farm fields to get back to the lower lying Savonen dairy farm homestead. If the snow was old and crusty, they glided effortlessly over the top of it with their heavy, stiff hickory skis.\nEven though traveling long distances in the dead of an upper Midwest winter in a 1930’s or 1940’s automobile could be a precarious undertaking, the crowd size at Wolverine and other prominent ski jumping venues like Suicide Hill in Ishpeming routinely numbered in the thousands. Numerous vendors capitalized on the community event by selling culturally specific cuisine (with ketchup, of course!).\nAlas in 1963, the Wolverine ski hill scaffold was partially destroyed. Yeah, you guessed it. The culprit was a severe wind storm. A partially reconstructed inrun ramp enabled periodic use of a scaled down Wolverine during the 1965 - 1968 timeframe for practice and local or unsanctioned competitions.",

    "section": "2.4 Slab Riders",
    "text": "2.4 Slab Riders\nFast forward to the mid-1960’s, Willie and wife Shirley (Mom) are raising daughter (Wendy) and younger son (me). My first ski ride was on my father’s shoulders while he glided down the gentle 10 foot slope from our Ironwood Aurora Location house to the Richards’ yard next door. For that occasion or when going to Mt. Joy in Wakefield, Dad brushed on layers of pungent smelling shellac and rubbed paraffin wax of the appropriate color for that day’s snow conditions onto his three groove hickory jumping skis. Somewhere in the basement, he found and dusted off his low-cut leather jumping boots that hadn’t regularly seen snow in over a decade.\n\nIn contemporary terms, a slab rider is someone that is part of a culture that creates customized vehicles known as slabs. In the broader skiing world, a slab rider is a backcountry skier who may find themselves on top of an unstable slab of snow that could trigger an avalanche and lead to their untimely demise. But for local Yoopers, slab rider was a simpler, but less than complimentary moniker applied by non-skiers to all alpine skiers and their wooden slabs.\n\nThe initial love of slab riding for Wendy and myself got legs (and skis, of course) when our parents scrounged up money for the less expensive local alpine ski hills, such as Eagle Bluff (Hurley), Mt. Zion (Ironwood), and occasionally Whitecap (Upson). It was a treat when we were dropped off for three hours of Wednesday or Saturday night skiing at Big Powderhorn Mountain. The occasional splurge was a full Saturday’s worth of skiing.\nAt Powderhorn, the technique for using the bunny hill rope tow was not intuitive for this 7 year-old. After a few face plants and near tears, I eventually mastered it by gradually, not suddenly, tightening my grip on the moving rope. After bearing with snide comments by a rich bunny hill brat about my cheap and undersized ski equipment and persuaded by big sister Wendy waving gleefully and proudly from the chair lift overhead, I was motivated to graduate. When venturing to the top of 600 vertical foot Big Powderhorn Mountain, I realized that although the ski runs were much longer, most hill sections were not steeper nor more difficult than the steepest part of the bunny hill. It was an early lesson to maintain poise and confidence while graduating step by step to ever larger ski jumps.\nEven though it was an alpine ski area, we’d tend to ski off trail, dodge trees, and create small kickers (small jumps with an upward ramp) on the side of the main trail to practice rudimentary acrobatics. By the way, when propelled vertically by a kicker and landing a short distance further on flat ground, the impact is far greater than landing after flying several hundred feet on any well designed ski jump hill.\nAnyway, these antics paled in comparison to the somersaulting stunts of off-trail hotshots with last names like Noren and Bertini in full view of chair lift riders overhead. At that time, only a few could admire the radical skills of these predecessors of free style skiing which now attracts national and Olympic attention. Fun-killing ski patrollers would eventually come along, and in the name of safety, rope off ungroomed trail sections or have youth-made bumps eradicated by the hill groomers.\nWhen we weren’t obeying signs posted along the runs, we sought additional excitement. On a clear, dark night, a ride up the chair lift offered the opportunity to check for the Northern Lights, name the constellations, and watch for a shooting star or high-flying jet. To keep our adrenaline pumping, and on a whim under the cloak of darkness, we would contort ourselves to swap positions on the two-seater chair lift while dangling 30 feet above the ground. Why? I don’t know. Because it was daring and a challenge.\nYet, the sibling standard for adventurous thrill seeking was pioneered by my sister (in her younger days). She boldly jumped off the Powderhorn chair lift one evening, as if it was a typical thing to do. As with some daredevil acts, the actual risk is often less than the risk perceived by non-participating observers. She jumped from a negotiable height into deep snow after removing her skis.\nLater, she trumped that adventure by somehow navigating her way to the very top of the monstrous Copper Peak ski flying hill scaffold while it was still in the finishing stages of construction. Chain link enclosures protecting the open-air walkways were not yet in place. I wouldn’t hazard to do that then or now, and I’m supposed to be the risk-taking ski jumper of the family.",

    "title": "3  The Iron Bowl",
    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 Iron Bowl Shape\nAcknowledging limitations of the scaled down Wolverine after the 1963 storm damage, the ardent Gogebic Range Ski Club (GRSC) committed to re-energizing local and youth ski jumping. The Caves provided the location. As named locally, the Caves are the east-west orientated land subsidence originating over the abandoned underground mines just 2 - 3 city blocks south of downtown Ironwood. There are no known open crevices, or caves per se, but Caves is vernacular for cave-in. It is a 1½ mile long by ¼ mile wide ravine with one side faced with 25 - 100 foot cliffs of dark rust iron rock. Decades before creative volunteerism established today’s Miner’s Memorial Heritage Park, the Caves were an unofficial local playground for snowmobiling, motorbiking, juvenile exploration, and multiple ski jumps.\nBy GRSC initiative in the late 60’s, the Caves location opposite the Ironwood Little League field became the venue for a new family of ski jumps. A few hundred yards west of the municipal landfill, the Iron Bowl, as it was named, had ski jumps ranging in size from 10m to 30m created on the Caves’ steep slopes. The ski club exploited the unnatural landscape by designing and grading a set of two ski jump landing hills out of the iron ore mining recesses.\nThroughout the U.P. in the early 1900’s, it was common that employees and their families lived in modest housing on hills in proximity to actual mining operations. The Aurora was one of a string of mines situated across the east-west Gogebic Range that briefly led the nation in iron ore production, peaking around 1930. By 1967, the last high-quality ore was railroaded out of the Gogebic Range and the mines were closed. Steep, miniature mountain ranges of rust-orange iron ore tailings and abandoned mining structures were left behind as an imposing and somber testament to the industriousness of the first half of the 1900’s.\nThe primary (and largest) ski jump was the 30m, where jumping distances in excess of 100 feet were readily achievable. The contours of the inrun and landing were designed by Supercynski in compliance with evolving jumping hill standards of the time, including a 10° downward sloping take-off table. The upper half of the inrun consisted of a 25 foot high scaffold of creosoted telephone poles and frugally obtained plank lumber. The scaffold merged into a graded rock slope transitioning to the take-off table. Construction of the Iron Bowl was completed in time for the inaugural meet in 1969.\nDesigned with the evolving jump hill architecture that called for greater than 10° downward slope at take-off, a relatively long knoll, and a contoured landing hill, it ensured flight trajectories rarely exceeded 10 feet off the ground. This was a stark contrast to flat take-off tables and extremely high flights prevalent during the early history of the sport.\nAs mentioned, the 30m inrun was part artificial (scaffold) and part natural (graded iron ore tailing slope) so it was in the minority of Midwest jumping hills. Most of the smaller jumps in the Midwest were either all scaffold, or all natural. Not unusual for smaller jumping hills, it had only one starting level at the top of the inrun.\nTo start the Iron Bowl ride from the top of the scaffold, the jumper pushed off a backboard with the tail of one ski. Sometimes, it would become a game within a game, trying to fire out from the top of the scaffold, practically leaping onto the beginning of the inrun track. Another technique was to tip into the track, then take a few rapid cross country skier strides, before dropping into the aerodynamic inrun crouch. The resulting inrun speed benefit was debatable, but at least the jumper looked like he was all-in.\nIn the 70’s, larger jumping hills usually had multiple starting gate platforms that angled into the main inrun track at different heights. The gate chosen for that day (or that competition round) was based on the speed of the inrun conditions and how far jumpers were flying in practice or the previous competition round. At the Iron Bowl, the adjustment was more rudimentary by simply cutting back or adding to the length of the take-off in an iterative fashion. Since the Iron Bowl had an oversized landing hill in proportion to the inrun, this approach worked fine. Although the longest jumps at the Iron Bowl rarely exceeded 120 feet, the landing hill slope was capable of handling more than 130 feet.\nOn today’s major hills, the opportunity to gain a starting speed advantage is all but eliminated. The jumper cannot aggressively push off, but begins the ride by gently releasing from a sitting position on a horizontal bench notched in the center of the track. The bench is positioned incrementally higher or lower on the inrun ramp in response to track speeds of that day. A slight inrun speed advantage results by maintaining a quiet, aerodynamic crouch. As such, a heavier jumper and skis facilitates higher inrun speed.\nYet, once in the air, greater weight and gravity conspire to oppose longer flights, especially on bigger hills with modern hill profiles. Moreover, for an increasing number of larger and international hills, the inrun track surface itself is now made of artificial surfaces, which treats ski friction with less skier-to-skier prejudice than snow, especially over a variety of temperature and humidity conditions.\nSince the Iron Bowl hill was essentially in a ravine, the second half of the outrun rose steeply on the opposite side. Unlike most other ski jumping hills, braking maneuvers upon completion of the ride were unnecessary. With the rise of the outrun naturally slowing the jumper to a stop, a jumper would get a gentle downhill ride back to the bottom of the landing hill. It saved a little walking distance and time before removing skis and heading up the landing hill for the next ride. As secondary entertainment on icy nights after a January thaw, we would ride far up the outrun hill, and then return with speed up part of the landing hill.\nIronwood had an advantage over other regional ski jumping locations, as it usually receives more snow over a longer calendar period (from before Thanksgiving until at least mid-March). Since most of the tournament circuit didn’t begin until early January, our club could use late November and most of December as our own preseason practice. Conversely, the disadvantage of lake effect snowfall is if heavy snowfall continues throughout the winter, it adds to the arduous chore of hill preparation.\nSnowmobilers were the bane of the ski jumping community. Not as damaging as some mischievous, alcohol infused rogue running a pick-up roughshod over a golfing green, it was not uncommon to find snowmobile tracks on the landing hill when arriving for another day or evening of jumping. It was not surprising that a steep, firmly packed and nicely groomed hill would be a temptation for wannabe Evel Knievel’s. But it was a form of vandalism, creating disruptive ruts that forced repairs to the landing hill surface.",

    "text": "3.2 Launch and Learn\nDad was curious as to whether his son would gravitate to ski jumping. So, on the rock outcropping 100 yards up the road from the Savonen Aurora Location home (where a local youngster might assume that aurora borealis was viewable in any community on a clear night), he shoveled a ski jump into existence. Two goldenrod weeds marked the jump take-off. For an 8 year old, it was Olympic size. With schoolmate Gary and myself the only riders in its brief history, the final hill record plateaued at 28 feet, or a bit short of the 1808 world record of 31 feet. With abandoned mining structures at the top of the hill precluding creation of a longer inrun and greater takeoff speeds, the hill record was secure. Nevertheless, the ‘trill’ of jumping was instilled.\nBy then in his late 30’s, Dad had fond memories of the defunct 30m Quarry Hill ski jump previously located in the Caves east of the Iron Bowl, where he competed in the early 1950’s. However, his favorite ski jump was the 35m Dynamite located just north of US2 and west of Section 12 Road on a bluff less than two miles from the Savonen family homestead.\nWith a new set of Iron Bowl jumping hills in place, GRSC launched a concerted effort to build the foundation of a ski jumping program, aided by local advertising. Though the quiet Finlander that he was, Dad still had ears to the ski jumping community.\nSo, one early winter Sunday in 1970, Dad took me to the Iron Bowl. There were about a dozen jumpers present, most of them using the largest (30m) hill. And that’s where we met Walter (Wally) Kusz, the chief orchestrator. We were enthusiastically welcomed, and after some discussion, I was coaxed to try riding the smaller landing hill.\nSnapping on my alpine skis at the knoll, I mustered the courage and slowly snowplow turned to start heading downhill. The hill surface was very smooth. As I steadily picked up speed, I didn’t expect that the slope would increase so rapidly and continuously. When I reached the steepest part of the downhill slope, and could finally see the bottom of the hill, it felt like I was going straight down. I hadn’t signed up for this.\nAfter another moment of descent, I bailed (sat down), and spun out. Sheepish though I was, Dad and others encouraged me to try again, while leaning forward into the downhill slope. On the second try, I did just that and then crouched low to the ground to stay upright through the transition (or dip) at the bottom of the landing hill. By 3rd or 4th try, I conquered the entire landing hill in a wobbly, but fully upright fashion. “I guess I’ll come back tomorrow”.\n\n\n\nBasic Ski Jump Hill Terminology\n\n\n\nKnoll – the relatively flat part of the landing hill starting at the end of the jump (take-off table) and ending after transitioning to a steeper constant part of the landing slope between the P-Point and the K-Point. Jumping hills are designed for ski jumpers to land after the knoll on the steeper slope that follows.\nK-Point – see Appendix for detailed explanation.\nDip – bottom of the landing hill, where the transition to the flat outrun is nearly complete, and well beyond where ski jumpers can be safely landing.\nPanking – Yooper term for packing snow with skis while sidestepping down the hill.\n\nAlongside the inrun of the 30m Iron Bowl jump and its scaffold, a 2-foot high snow bump was angled into the main landing hill, creating a 15m capable jump. Although the maximum achievable jumping distance was maybe 45 feet, beginners could experience the exhilaration of ski jumping and aerodynamic lift for the first time.\nHow time flies! Just 6 years later, I enjoyed my small part in helping prepare the Copper Peak landing hill, holding onto ropes while sidestepping and panking the hundreds of yards of the 40° sloped landing hill. Besides watching the tournament, my personal thrill as an early teen was the opportunity to ride the entire Copper Peak landing hill while crouched in an inrun tuck position the entire distance. It was speed to burn, baby and no radar in the area. I am sure that it was the fastest that I ever traveled on skis, and well in excess of 70 mph considering that ski flyers reach the low to mid-60’s shooting down an inrun that is considerably shorter than the landing hill.\n\n\n\nIron Bowl 30m and 15m Ski Jumps (1971)\n\n\nWe modified my alpine equipment to partially resemble jumping skis, at least so the ski boot heel could lift from the ski, enabling a forward lean in the air like a genuine ski jumper. With most alpine ski bindings of that era, the back of the ski boot rigidly attached to the ski by a cable wrapping around the heel. By removing the two cable guides on the sides of the ski closest to the heel, the heel was free to lift from the ski.\nAfter I used the modified alpine skis for a few months, Dad obtained a set of used, but actual jumping skis. Real jumping skis with wood-fiberglass composite core and five grooves on the plastic bottom surface! They were 50% wider, 70% longer, and at least 3 – 4 times heavier than my little alpine skis. If I was alpine skiing in the evening following a day of ski jumping, muscle memory made those alpine skis feel like toothpicks.\nThose dark blue Elan jumping skis provided an early 70’s luxury Cadillac smooth, muscle car Trans Am fast ride. In a drag race down the landing hill, anyone with jumping skis would surge past the alpine skier like all other cars passing Dad’s ’59 Studebaker struggling up Birch Hill. At 255 cm long (8 foot 4 inches), the jumping skis were 6 - 8 inches oversized for my 5 foot and change height at the time, but I didn’t care.\nDuring ensuing weekends, a few of us youngsters were introduced to the actual sport of ski jumping. While Dad facilitated my interest and introduction to ski jumping, Wally Kusz was my first (and realistically only) ski jumping coach, with all due respect to many others who gave me an occasional tip or guidance over the years. With a distinct accent, as did nearly every first or second generation Yooper, he exuded an infectious enthusiasm. He also had a keen eye for identifying minor deviations from the fundamentals that he knew would yield success on any jumping hill, as he would emphasize:\n\n“It’s all in takeoff.”\n“Timing is crucial. Don’t jump too early or too late.”\n“In the inrun, keep your shin angle forward, back flat and level, and head up.”\n“When you jump, explode, keeping your chest down, and head level.”\n“Never, ever drop your head.”\n“When in the air, your body follows your head, just like a bird. So, always keep your head up and steady, while looking out over your skis and stretching for the bottom of the hill.”\n\nWally described the lift during the early stages of flight over the knoll as someone grabbing you by the back of your belt. Until then, my only reference of someone being grabbed and lifted by the back of the belt came from our fourth grade teacher. One day he escorted another misbehaving and then petrified classmate horizontally out of the classroom by the back of his belt, while he frantically hand surfed across classmates’ desks on the way to the principal’s office. Well, that was 1969 classroom discipline.\nIn a not so obvious parallel to hitting a baseball on the sweet spot of the bat barrel, a perfectly executed ski jump produces longer distances with seemingly minimal effort. The primary elements to achieving that ski jumping sweet spot is nailing the timing exactly with a quick and powerful take-off and transitioning quickly and smoothly to an optimal flight position. The fruits of all that are extra lift, and after clearing the knoll, an extended, almost weightless flight peering over skis and sighting beyond the hill bottom.\nWhile the primary event during the Iron Bowl junior ski jumping tournaments was the 30m hill, we had the opportunity to be ski jumping competitors for the first time. Prior to the 30m big boy meet, some of us competed on the 15m junior hill. I soared to 37 feet and 1st place. I was hooked.\nNaturally, that big 30m jump began to quietly taunt us. “Can you handle me?” or in Yooper barnyard language “Or, are you chickens@&t?” So, one Saturday afternoon while the senior ski jumpers were competing at a late season out-of-town tournament, my neighborhood buddy Todd and I traversed the half mile of Caves snowmobile trails from home to the Iron Bowl determined to scale the monster for the first time.\nThe cardinal rules to ensure safe ski jumping (besides proper technique) include:\n\nNever jump alone.\nPrepare the hill adequately.\nEnsure mature supervision.\nUse the hill and equipment as designed.\n\nWell, between the two of us that day, we weren’t alone (check) and the hill was in good condition (check). But, we fell short of the last two rules. We convinced ourselves that it would be safer if we limited takeoff speed by starting only halfway up the 30m inrun. Neither of us were educated in basic physics that dictate fighter jets use the full length of the aircraft carrier runway to avoid plunking into the sea.\nWith our take-off speed compromised, both of us soared into the air and then stalled midair like Wile E. Coyote overshooting a cliff. We should have been holding his “Uh-Oh” sign before plummeting to the ground. The flights were short and impactful onto the nearly flat knoll. It hurt more than a little bit. Both of us wiped out, but being young and flexible, we were uninjured. We had had enough for the day. Being that it was March, the jumping season was finished for the year.",

    "text": "3.3 Yooper Junior Jumping\nThe Iron Bowl was our home hill from 1969 thru 1975. During the 1971 jumping season, some of us graduated to the 30m hill. As we previously realized the hard way, appropriate use of the 30m jump involved using the entire length of the inrun scaffold. It was a mental commitment walking up to the top of the 25 ft high scaffold for the first time. Although no one would dare ostracize a first time rider who decided to walk back down, it would be personally embarrassing. For me, it was cool to be at the top of the scaffold with the senior jumpers. Any lingering concerns had been swept aside.\nBefore launching down the inrun for a practice ride on most small hills, the jumper yells down to a spotter (usually a fellow jumper or coach) on the knoll who has a clear view of the entire hill to confirm that there are no obstructions or people in the path of the skier. Having received a clear affirmative response from the knoll, it’s go time.\nPushing off from the top of the scaffold for my first 30m ride, I settled into the inrun track. Accelerating with each passing evergreen twig marking the inrun track, it took so long to get to the takeoff. And then, the last bough at the end of the inrun finally arrived, and it was time to leap. Even though it was a short flight for the scale of a 30m jump, the flight was much higher and longer than what I had grown accustomed to on the 15m, or the ill-conceived half scaffold ride. Yet, the landing was much gentler. A long ride down the rest of the landing completed my personal victory. After a few days of gaining confidence and doing more than just surviving the hill, it was time to start earnestly addressing details to become a competent ski jumper.\nSki jumping is governed nationally by the United States Ski Association (USSA), organized across the country by divisions (or regions). In the 70’s, there were well over two dozen active ski jumping clubs in the USSA Central Division at that time, encompassing the western U.P, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and northern Illinois. By registering with the USSA, a jumper would receive an ID card and gain access to enter tournaments.\nJunior USSA members were subdivided into four classes by age:\n\nClass 1: 16-18 years old\nClass 2: 14-15 years old\nClass 3: 12-13 years old\nClass 4: 9-11 years old\n\nStriving to improve one’s skills and confidence while climbing the age group ladder, the ultimate goal after graduating from junior to senior class at age 19 was to be competing amongst the best senior ‘A’ class, the elite of which formed the U.S. national team and competed internationally.",

    "text": "3.4 Iron Bowl Culture\nThe 1972 – 1974 winters was a growth period for the club. Over the summer of 1971, the industrious GRSC leaders executed on foresight to erect lights on the 30m Iron Bowl jumping hill. Evening ski jumping was ‘on’. The lights were indispensable, an advantage many of the other Midwest ski clubs already enjoyed.\nBefore then, the opportunities for Iron Bowl ski jumping were limited to weekends. With the ‘state of the art’ mercury vapor lights, from mid-to-late November until early March, jumping was possible nearly every weeknight. It contributed to the number of club jumpers doubling to more than two dozen, with two thirds of us being junior class age (18 or younger). Each of us could complete 5 - 10 practice rides over a 2 - 3 hour period, if we weren’t occupied with digging the ski hill out from the latest lake effect snow.\nWhen convening many winter evenings at the Iron Bowl hill, one becomes acquainted with the jumping styles and personalities of fellow jumpers. There was little formal coaching, but fellow jumpers tended to encourage each other. Most Iron Bowl jumpers in the early 70’s were accomplished high school or former athletes in other sports. In a sense, they were the unintentional forerunners of today’s sport culture awakening to the physical and psychological benefits of youngsters participating in multiple sports across all four seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWillie Savonen – Junior Jumper (circa 1946)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCraig Savonen - Junior Jumper (1973)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: Dad as a young teenager with his solid hickory skis and three grooves roughly carved into the bottoms. All purpose leather boots attached to skis with leather overstraps, metal front throws and cables. Attired with collared undershirt, Christmas sweater, baggy wool pants, and brimmed cap. Savonen dairy farm and gravel pit in background.\nRight: The author as a 12 year old with my Northland composite five-groove plastic bottom jumping skis, although oversized for my stature. Nylon-leather jumping boots attached to skis with all metal cable throws, cables, and toeplates. Attired with winter sweater, stretch pants, soft knit cap, and choppers (Yooper for leather mittens with inner wool liners). Goggles and helmets were a thing of the future.\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, most of my fellow local jumpers were in high school. It included football and wrestling stars and family legacy jumpers, with colorful personalities amongst all of them. The unique challenges and thrills of ski jumping attracted a diverse group.\nOne of our all-sport high school stars was having a mediocre ski jumping evening that didn’t measure up to his own Type-A expectations, despite being unable to consistently give attention to the sport. At the bottom of the hill after what turned out to be his last jump of the night, he ripped off his skis and threw them like javelins twenty yards into the deep snow while expletives cascaded across the walls of the Iron Bowl ravine. We didn’t see him much after that.\nOne of the senior cats still jumping well past age 40 (after he started to ski jump in his 30’s) was Bob Shea. Although Bob wasn’t a ski jumping Olympian, he had the heart of a ski jumper and was part of the ski club soul for many years.\nBy the late 1970’s, when there were less than a handful of us still jumping locally (by then at Wolverine), Bob would periodically take a break from cross country skiing to watch a few of our jumps. After complimenting one of my practice rides, he did not hesitate to plant the vision of going to the Olympics. Little did he know that that goal was already quietly embedded in my mind. But, it gave credence to my vision when hearing someone else speak out loud to the belief that it was achievable.\nAnother fellow Iron Bowl jumper was athletic, but he wasn’t an athlete, meaning he couldn’t muster complete commitment to the sport. That didn’t lessen the enjoyment he got from recreational participation. Typical of most ski jumpers, he was part of a ski jumping family legacy.\nOn the side, he was reputedly active in small scale pot distribution. Whereas today, each new cannabis business opening of the now multi-billion-dollar Michigan industry is celebrated with mayoral ribbon cutting and a front page story in the local Daily Globe newspaper, in the 70’s it was necessarily underground and stigmatized. Anyway, this free spirit and purported cannabis distributor had a fun loving, outgoing personality.\nWhen putting on his skis at the top of the Iron Bowl scaffold one evening, he stepped into the ski toeplates as usual, but absentmindedly forgot to attach the cables to the back of his boots before launching down the inrun. OK, admittedly the Iron Bowl lights did not fully illuminate the top platform of the scaffold and he wasn’t the most detailed oriented guy, or maybe it was just an extra hazy day.\nIn retrospect, we watched an amazingly smooth inrun ride until he reached the end of jump. At that point, Kaos triumphed over Control. Normally, our Maxwell Smart had the habit of letting his skis spread apart just before take-off, abandoning the set inrun tracks. Perhaps it was his ‘drawing outside the lines’ metaphor for life.\nBut in this particular situation, he was fortunate. As he cleared the jump, a detached left ski dived to the left and a similarly free right ski dived to the right. In ski jumping slang, he was ‘rolling down the windows’ as he frantically windmilled his arms while flying past those of us standing on the knoll.\nThe center of the landing hill waited to receive him as he completed his 35 mph airwalk. Fortunately, due to good jumping hill design, our pal encountered a soft landing. He achieved an unofficial distance of 40 feet, although I think his skis flew further. He was uninjured, unfazed, and after trudging through the deep snow on both sides of the landing to retrieve his wayward skis, he was ready to go for another ride. We all hooted and laughed, including him.\nAs detailed later, although serious injuries are rare in this sport, the worst case situation is a head injury, if impacting violently with skis or ground. Helmets didn’t become standard ski jumping equipment until stipulated by the USSA in the mid-70’s. At that time, even ski flyers usually wore only a soft cotton ski cap or beanie. Some ski flyers wore neither goggles nor any head covering. Peter Wilson of the Canadian National Team garnered 4th place in 1973 on the huge ski flying Copper Peak hill. As captured below, he approaches his landing without compromising style.\n\n\n\nCanadian National Team Member Peter Wilson on Copper Peak\n\n\nHowever, by the late 70’s, anyone expecting to compete in a USSA sanctioned meet had to wear a helmet. The first editions of ski jumping helmets were not stylish. The available soft plastic cap resembled an early 1900’s bathing cap adorned with colorful soft foam rectangular ridges. For that brief period, it could be embarrassing to a style conscious teen, but we were all in the same boat probably thinking, but not saying “Hey, you’re a circus clown, too.”\nThankfully, just a couple of years later, the equipment standard had graduated to a classical hard outer shell ‘sphere’, akin to what contact and automotive sports had been using for years. With that type of helmet and goggles in place, I felt very safe in my own little world, regardless of the size of the hill or others around me.\nDuring the span of 1972-1974, I was fortunate to be the Ironwood Schools city alpine ski champion in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. It included the disciplines of slalom, giant slalom, and downhill. In the woulda category, I woulda been the 5th grade champion, too, but I took the wrong side of the last gate in the slalom run. While in the starting gate, we were warned about the tricky location of the last gate, even though the turn itself would have been easy to make. But, it was too much for a fifth grader in his first ski race to process, when notified seconds before launching down the run.\nTheron Peterson, the veteran Ironwood High coach of alpine skiing and several other sports, urged me to join the alpine team. I was honored, but I regrettably felt it was necessary to decline. During the compressed winter season, I didn’t know how I could do justice to both ski sports and for that matter, how my parents could absorb the additional cost of a second sport. Nevertheless, periodic recreational alpine skiing provided valuable cross training that benefitted ski jumping balance and agility.\nAs mentioned by Supercynski, a limited number of years remained for continued use of the Iron Bowl, since the Ironwood municipal authority was clamoring for more landfill space in the Caves property that they controlled. And even more problematically, with years passing since the underground mines were abandoned, the steadily rising water table would eventually peek above ground in the bottom of the Caves ravine.",

Until the late 70’s, the Gogebic Range Ski Club had a nucleus of ski jumpers who maintained the local ski jump, trained, and traveled together nearly every weekend to a Midwest tournament from the first full week of January through the middle of March. Most of the intermediate to large hills comprising that circuit are mapped below.\nMost of us had our own favorite hill, for various reasons. Perhaps it was the air currents on the hill, the detailed attention that the local club applied to hill preparation, the efficiency of meet registration (on-site in this era), or the ease in traversing the snow paths up the hill and scaffold. On each weekend, there were usually two or more senior level tournaments simultaneously occurring on intermediate and large hills somewhere in the Midwest circuit. A USSA coordinated schedule enabled ski clubs to reserve their calendar spot year after year.\nAs I progressed through a relatively brief jumping career (1968 – 1981), I had the privilege of riding most, but not all, of the intermediate and large ski jumps in the region. However, due to meet cancellations or personal scheduling conflicts, I never had the chance to ride the ‘far south’ hills in northern Illinois, i.e. Rockford and Fox River Grove.",

    "text": "4.2 Big Miron\nWhen I was still in junior class, we seldom ventured to the bigger hills, but one of the first was Big Miron in Iron Mountain, Michigan. The tournament at Big Miron was one of the few of comparable size to the Iron Bowl, and so it provided a favorable opportunity for young jumpers to get better. It was an all-scaffold hill, with the main inrun and mini-jumps designed into a permanent steel scaffold. Jumping distances barely exceeded 100 feet.\nAs common on a number of small hills, the meet was broken into two days, with junior (classes 1 - 4) and female competitions being on one day and senior events being on the other.\nThe results of the competition for that day were determined by jumping distance in one round and subjective style in another round. The jumper would get 4 or 5 rides for the entire meet plus warm up practice beforehand. In that era, judges’ scores were not publicly displayed until after the meet had concluded since the scoreboards were either non-existent or positioned in ways not easily viewed by the athletes. Although there were 5 style judges, the high and low scores were tossed and the remaining three judges’ scores were added together.\n\nStyle judging criteria are standardized across the sport. They include quality of the flight (e.g. body position and steadiness) during the three phases of flight (take-off, mid-air, landing), and, of course, a solid Telemark landing with one foot in front of the other and arms and hands extended for positional balance. A Hollywood Telemark was slang for the less skillful, but showy attempt of transitioning to a Telemark position, but only after landing.\n\nEven though the small hill scaffold was not that tall, the climb could still be unsettling for a young jumper accustomed to natural inruns, especially with others whizzing by just 4 - 5 feet to one’s side. On the way up, you had to make sure that your stiff boots didn’t slip on the 37° sloped wooden ‘cattle ramp’ which was never completely clear of ice and snow. Although I neither witnessed nor heard of it happening, it was conceivable that a skier climbing up the scaffold could have a momentary brain fade and while looking back down the hill, swing his skis into the path of a rider zooming down the inrun. At the top, the tight confines limited three, or at most four, jumpers being able to put their skis down, quickly strap them on, check equipment, and compose themselves before being flagged to go.\nBig Miron was Therese Altobelli’s home hill. A phenom in her pre-teen and early teen years, Therese received notoriety as the pioneering female jumper of the era, particularly in the Midwest region. She was steady and stylish, competing equally with the rest of us young juniors. As fellow jumpers, we didn’t make much of it. At the risk of sounding politically incorrect in today’s culture, she was just one of the boys.\nThe fanfare surrounding her wasn’t her doing, but she was friendly, poised, and seemed to take it all in stride, while adults made a big deal about it. Therese just wanted to ski jump. Perhaps her most notable ski jumping accomplishment was a few years later in 1978 when she became the first female to ride the famous 90m Pine Mountain, her home hill. In 2017, Therese was elected to the National Ski Hall of Fame, a forebearer of the female U.S. national team that became internationally competitive during ensuing decades.",

    "title": "4  The Midwest Circuit",
    "section": "4.3 Wolverine Regenerated",
    "text": "4.3 Wolverine Regenerated\nIn the early 70’s, there were regular attempts at using the scaled down and repaired Wolverine scaffold, to fill the need for a hill bigger than the 30m Iron Bowl. The scaled down Wolverine in the mid-to-late 60’s was handicapped in that it was neither shaped to contemporary specifications nor consistent with its original design roots before a storm raised havoc. It was a hybrid of sorts. The partially salvaged inrun had a steep top half, followed by a sharp transition to a long, effectively flat takeoff table. It couldn’t be used for sanctioned competition although it still provided big air ride for recreational purposes.\nIt took forethought, expertise, and determination by several stalwart members of the ‘Greatest Generation’ to get Wolverine rebuilt and back on stage in 1975. To bring Wolverine back to life, the ski jumping community was fortunate to have the unflinching commitment of a relatively small group, led by former jumpers, such as Wally Kusz, Bob Shea, Frank Pribyl, Charlie Supercynski and others that I apologize for failing to recall or being unaware. Others with little personal ski jumping history were also very active, committed supporters, such as Ernie Mattson, Ed Lakner, and Don Bull. Their altruistic support was extensive and inspiring.\nThe entire Wolverine jumping hill had to be re-contoured to the updated profile. Charlie Supercynski led the redesign and summarized the cost efficient material and labor. It took intensive effort by a modest size crew to get Wolverine back on its feet, including re-profiling the landing hill, reshaping a longer knoll, reworking the entire inrun slope by moving tons of earth, and constructing an entirely new scaffold on top of it. With the complete revision of Wolverine to prevailing 1975 hill standards, the region could once again point with pride to the historic 55m (some say 50m) ski jumping hill.\nNot to rehash its rich history prior to the 1975 rebuild, the new Wolverine established an invaluable bridge to prepare local ski jumpers for larger hills in addition to attracting national level competition. Before Wolverine was re-established in 1975, I was impressed how a few of the more experienced Ironwood jumpers, such as John and Mike Kusz, Bruce and Gene Harma, Russ Anderson and several others could venture to ride the large 90m hills like Pine Mountain or Westby, even though their preparation was limited primarily to the small 30m Iron Bowl, the scaled down Wolverine, or brief experiences on a few other intermediate size hills.\nWolverine had a long reputation of riding like a bigger hill, due to the prevailing northwesterly winds in the Ironwood Township Section 12 Road valley. The face of the bluff upon which Wolverine was built points directly into that wind (and did I mention toward the old Savonen homestead?). These natural headwinds provide jumpers with an airstream comparable to the next larger hill class. A steady headwind favors the aerodynamic lift of birds, kites, airplanes, and ski jumpers. On sunny days with a gentle breeze, it was not unusual to see a hawk or eagle hovering motionlessly high overhead.\nAfter executing an excellent take-off, a ski jumper transitioning into flight position was met by an airspeed differential (skier speed + opposing headwind velocity) that produced an exhilarating lift. With the lower and more lateral flight trajectory of the updated Wolverine hill design, a ski jumper had to take full advantage of the airlift to be successful.\n\n\n\nThe ‘New’ Wolverine in the Late 1970’s\n\n\nWith Wolverine’s reputation for big air and early season lake effect snowfall, it influenced the U.S. national ski jumping team to jump at the opportunity to be the first few to practice and compete on its updated version, prior to the arrival of the regular competitive season.\nThe 1975-1976 season could also be characterized as a two decade (1960 – 1980) highpoint for local ski jumping, accentuated by the inaugural December 1975 tournament. Besides the U.S. national team and other regional riders, the tournament included seven local jumpers, five of which were in their last year or two of junior class age. Within the next three years, life’s circumstances dictated that all but John Kusz and I had effectively retired from the sport, and I couldn’t stay much longer, retiring by 1981.\nDuring practice on Wolverine, if taking full advantage of top gate inrun speed, you could enjoy long flights. If still 7 – 10 feet above the landing hill after clearing the knoll, you could peer over the skis to the bottom of the hill slope and outrun.\n\n\n\n1975 – 76 Gogebic Range Ski Jumping Octet at Wolverine\n\n\nOne of my most memorable rides occurred on one sunny, but otherwise unremarkable Saturday afternoon practice. Only three of us were riding one day, so our small crew alternated between being the jumper at the top of the inrun or standing at the knoll to flag the next jumper.\nAs I cleared the knoll during one flight, I knew it was a very good ride. Like other sports when an athlete is ‘in the zone’, time pauses and sound nearly ceases. All I could hear was a very gentle tap-tap as my ski tips lightly touched each other a couple of times during flight. And then, after what seemed like a long time, the ride had come to an end, and I landed softly as a feather.\nAn additional benefit of a northwest facing ski hill like Wolverine was that it was mostly shielded from direct winter sunlight which can soften or melt snow during mid-winter thaws, thus requiring extra effort to keep the inrun covered with snow or bring a premature end to the jumping season. The Wolverine inrun and landing were also protected from direct sunlight most of the winter day by trees lining its southwesterly side. (Less favorably, the Copper Peak ski flying hill faces southeast, which increases the challenge of keeping the massive inrun and landing hill prepared with adequate snow covering, especially if a mid-winter thaw occurs).\nThe first full winter (1976) of new Wolverine tested our stamina for hill preparation since snowfall totaled 265 inches, almost 100 inches greater than an average year on the Gogebic Range. By then, with the number of regularly active ski jumpers in the Ironwood area dwindled to a less than a dozen, it would have been impossible to keep both the Iron Bowl and Wolverine hills in shape. So, without lights on Wolverine at that juncture, jumping practice was limited to weekends.\nAs mentioned, although the early arriving and late departing snow in the Ironwood area would theoretically enable the longest jumping seasons in the Midwest (from mid-November until late March), the sheer effort for a small team to keep the hill in ski jumping shape throughout the winter did not afford more jumping uptime. More so, once the out-of-town ski jumping meet circuit commenced in early January, the number of weekends practicing on the home hill decreased further.\nOn an intermediate size hill, such as Wolverine, a solid day of practice amounted to anywhere from 8 - 12 rides. On a few rare days, the number of rides maxed out at greater than 15. Trudging up the landing hill and inrun would eventually be tiring, even for a young, fit athlete. In the late 70’s, when our ski jumping was largely limited to weekends, I personally totaled 175 – 225 jumps for an entire season, including out of town meets. In that regard, I envied some of my peers who had home hills with a rope tow or T-bar which facilitated 25 or more rides a day and a squadron of youth and adults to keep the jumping hill in shape, while generally dealing with less snowfall than Ironwood.\nMore so, a majority of the other ski jumping hills had lights, as did the 30m Iron Bowl before it had to be abandoned. We competed against clubs where zealous jumpers could accumulate more than 400 jumps a year. By the way, the governing International Ski Federation (FIS) is not prone to sanction international or ski flying hill meets nowadays if the facilities do not include a lift for the ski jumpers from the bottom of the hill to the top of the scaffold. C’mon, man. The hill climb was part of our cross training! In some international circles, there is even loose conceptual discussion about creating a fully enclosed tunnel along the entire length of the ski jump inrun. What?!",

    "text": "4.4 Suicide Hill\nA personal milestone in 1977 was riding the largest (70m) jump in the Ishpeming Suicide Hill complex for the first time. Listed at that time as a 70m, equivalent to the smaller of the two standard Olympic hill sizes, it represented a step up in hill size relative to Wolverine. The largest jump of the complex grew in stature from being rated as a 70m in the 70’s to now being labeled as a K90. Located in a picturesque valley, more recently it has jump sizes classified as 13m, 25m, 40m, 60m, and 90m. It also contained a cross country training center that constituted the U.P. Nordic Ski complex, which over the years has been affiliated with U.S. national ski organizations.\n\n\n\nSuicide Bowl Ski Jumping Complex (Ishpeming, MI)\n\n\nRich in ski jumping history, the Ishpeming / Negaunee area has hosted ski jumping competitions as far back as 1882, which influenced the location of the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame. Its inaugural tournament was held in 1925 and is one of the few remaining active ski jumps in the U.P. (The Ishpeming Suicide Hill is not to be confused with a smaller ski jump in New Boston, Massachusetts also named Suicide Hill that was destroyed by a storm in 1938.)\n\nWhat might be viewed as a culturally insensitive name for the Ishpeming hill was coined in 1926 by a local reporter upon witnessing a skier suffer an injury, although non-fatal. He defended the name, quoted as saying “Sure, it’s a good hill, but why not have a little color about it.” That attitude reflected the early 1900’s attitude to amplify ski jumping dangers to attract crowds (and readers), before the broader awareness and increased sensitivity to the tragedy of suicide was realized. Nevertheless, the name has stuck to this day.\n\nSuicide Hill was an annual stop for the U.S. national team, who were respected, if not envied, for their flashy uniforms, equipment, and accomplished coaches. These rock stars of the ski jumping circuit warmed up before the meet by pushing a soccer ball around the outrun, before the U.S. became a competitive participant in World Cup soccer. They also practiced stationary leaps from the ground into flight position on top of a teammate’s extended arms.\nIf you could competently ride Suicide, most ski jumps (outside of the ski flying hills) were within reach. As I sat with several senior Ironwood jumpers having breakfast at a local restaurant before heading out to ride Suicide for the first time, I couldn’t help thinking that the rest of the people in the restaurant were going on to their safe, mundane day, while we would be flying through the air and ignoring risk to life and limb.\nYou still had to walk up a narrow scaffold while a jumper zoomed down the inrun a few feet away. And, you certainly didn’t want to have so short a jump as to land on the ignominious ‘cowpath’. That was the narrow snow packed trail that forms across the upper knoll where hill personnel and officials regularly walked to and from the other side of the landing. Of course, they didn’t traverse across the knoll during when a jumper was coming!\nAs compared to some other hills, Suicide seemed to consistently reward distance when a jump was well executed. The curvature of the inrun transition to the take-off table was tighter than most intermediate size hills, imparting more compression when approaching the take-off. Even today, the take-off table is designed with at least one degree more hang (11.5°) than most other hills. This aligns the flight trajectory more closely with the steep (36.5°) landing table. Headwinds on this larger hill were not greater than that of Wolverine. Spurious gusts were uncommon since the ski jumping complex resided in a natural bowl.\nAs with any walk in life, one can find humor during incidental, but unique circumstances. At one Suicide Hill meet in the 70’s, the length of the outrun was extraordinarily short and slightly downward sloped. Despite hill design standards existing for inrun curvature, take-off angle, knoll shape, and landing hill slope (and having been more refined since then), the specifications for outrun profiles may not have been specific.\nJumpers ride through the dip of the steep landing onto the flat outrun with the highest speed of the entire ride. At most hills, there is adequate distance to slow down and ease to a stop with a combination of snowplow or other combination of parallel turns. Perhaps the outrun was intentionally shortened so a few more paying cars could be squeezed into the surrounding bowl. So, skiers could not absentmindedly glide to a casual stop. After completing the primary purposes of jumping, flying, and landing, one still had to alertly initiate a sliding stop immediately after the dip to avoid pounding into the snowbank at the end of the short outrun.\nDuring the second day of this particular meet, the accumulated effect of skiers aggressively skidding to a stop turned the outrun surface into an ice rink. Amongst jumpers in queue at the top of the scaffold, we snickered when we witnessed any jumper ahead of us run out of outrun length and crash into the snowbank. It was ski jumping gallows humor at its best.\nYet, we marveled at one jumper who adopted the unprecedented practice of starting to snowplow brake at high speed while still on the steepest part of the landing. It was a freakish athletic move predating Bo Jackson’s famous horizontal run along an outfield wall in 1990. By the tail end of the meet, the hill management finally placed hay bales at the end of the outrun to cushion skiers with inadequate braking skills or attentiveness.",

    "text": "4.5 Bulldozer\nBulldozer was a 55m jump carved out of the same ridge where Iron Mountain’s famous 90m Pine Mountain jump stood. It was uncommon for a hill of Bulldozer’s stature in the upper Midwest to have a mostly natural inrun and landing, but bulldozers accomplished that.\nI participated in a two Bulldozer meets, including one in 1977. Without a scaffold, it appeared smaller than it was when standing next to its big Pine Mountain brother, but Bulldozer still rode like a larger intermediate sized hill, comparable to Wolverine. I placed well in the meet, but a small, yet gratifying moment was being noticed by Ed Brisson, the previous head coach of the U.S. national team. A giant in the sport, he was involved in countless aspects of ski jumping for over 80 years (involvement years, not his age in years), in addition to being head coach for the Central Division, and later, the U.S. National team. He led advancements in training coaches, hill preparation techniques, and safety.\nMy interaction with him was brief, but as we know, a lasting impression can happen in an instant. One of the practice days was plagued by crosswind gusts that can create havoc with a ski jumper’s flight. Naturally hands-on, Coach Ed positioned himself on the knoll that windy day, volunteering as the flagman to signal each jumper to proceed when he sensed that the gusts had temporarily subsided.\nOn my best practice ride in terms of distance and smoothness, I noticed that I landed on the far right edge of the wide landing, barely a foot or so from the deep snowbank. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but during my next walk up the hill, Coach Ed complimented me for handling the stiff gusts so well, while lightheartedly apologizing for flagging me into it. Since Ed was a born Yooper in Munising (which had its own history of ski jumping until the 1980’s), his personable approach shouldn’t have been surprising.",

It was common for a carnival like setting attracting huge paying audiences. No less famous than P.T. Barnum’s circus incorporated ski jumping into their early venues. A professional ski jumping association actually formed in 1929, but disbanded by 1934, not for lack of demand or paying audience, but for lack of available, uninjured jumpers.\nThrills and spills were promoted as the reason to come and see exhibition riders attempt somersaults and other amazing gymnastic feats with ski equipment and scaffold construction that would astound the most fearless jumper today. To attract audiences, they reinforced the stereotype of a dangerous sport. Pictures of various ski jump scaffolds, for exhibitions of that era, attest to the laughably flimsy construction that would not pass any safety protocols today’s standards.",

At 17, I was one of the youngest in our group of eight Ironwood area jumpers traveling to Iron Mountain that weekend. Even though Pine Mountain was only 20 miles from Bulldozer, it was my first time there. The energy and anticipation were palpable as we approached the imposing scaffold.\nThe inrun at Pine Mountain was a thing of beauty – a long, sweeping curve of ice that seemed to stretch forever toward the take-off. The starting gate was so high that the view from the top encompassed miles of the surrounding forest. As I pushed off for my first ride, the acceleration was unlike anything I had experienced. The speed built steadily, compressing me into the inrun crouch with increasing G-forces.\nThen came the take-off, and for the first time, I truly understood what big hill ski jumping meant. The flight was long, smooth, and exhilarating. The landing hill seemed to unfurl below me in slow motion. When I finally touched down, I had traveled over 250 feet – longer than any jump I had ever made.",

The hill was imposing – larger than Pine Mountain and with a reputation for challenging conditions. The surrounding terrain created unpredictable wind patterns that could either help or hinder a jumper’s flight.\nThe Westby community embraced ski jumping with a passion that was inspiring. Thousands of spectators would gather for major events, transforming the hillside into a sea of enthusiastic fans. The atmosphere was electric, unlike anything I had experienced at smaller venues.\nPractice jumps at Westby required careful attention to wind conditions.

However, I had the privilege of watching world-class ski flyers compete at the Peak, witnessing the incredible spectacle of human flight.\nThe construction and maintenance of Copper Peak required enormous resources. The hill’s southeast orientation made snow management challenging, and the facility saw periods of inactivity during the 1970s and 1980s.

    "text": "6.3 Trial and Error\nMy first unique experience at Squaw Valley came during an early practice session. The hill had been prepared hurriedly, and critical alignment markers had been positioned incorrectly. On my practice jump, I launched from a take-off that wasn’t properly aligned with the landing below.\nThe first problem was immediately apparent as I cleared the knoll. I was in orbit, leaving behind the designed flight trajectory of the hill. We had started too high on the hill! I had as much height as riding the 90m Pine Mountain two weeks earlier, but this was only a 60m hill. Even though I hadn’t jumped with maximum power, my flight path was carrying me well past the bottom of the hill.\nThe second and more disturbing problem was that I was exiting stage left. I had centered the track between the prescribed markers at the take-off, but the markers had not been aligned between the inrun start and the center of the landing below. I was flying far left of the prepared landing hill, and this time it wasn’t caused by a stiff crosswind.\nAs I quickly scanned possible landing (or more appropriately crash) sites, I noticed a hill crew staff member far below scampering to safety as I plummeted directly toward him. He had been a half dozen feet off to the side of the landing, but that wasn’t far enough. He had concluded that the garden rake in his hand was no defense against this raptor descending upon him with 8 foot yellow talons.\nWhat a predicament. In normal situations, a ski jumper uses subtle positioning of hands like ailerons to guide flight direction. At great expense to style point in competition, more aggressive adjustments can be made with entire arms, even beyond ‘rolling down the windows’. In this circumstance, no amount of full body contortions was going to divert my flight back to the landing strip.\nExcept for airplane flight training or aerobatics, stall is what pilots call an undesirable event. Yet, in this situation, a forced emergency stall was the best recourse. By aggressively pulling back on body lean, bending sharply at the waist (aka jack knifing), and getting my legs and skis directly underneath my center of gravity, I mostly defeated forward velocity. Descending awkwardly from the sky, there was little I could do reduce vertical velocity since parachutes are not issued to ski jumpers.\nAs I was about to meet the ground, it was the first and only time that I closed my eyes. I crashed where some hill slope still remained, so the impact was not as traumatic as it could have been. More so, I landed in the fresh snowbank conveniently created during the previous day’s excavation. After one bounce and roll in the soft stuff, I came to an abrupt halt.\nFrom a flight that lifted off horizontally at 45 mph and descended the vertical height of a 60m landing hill, it was amazing. I was uninjured. As I collected myself and my equipment, hill staff rushed over to determine what medical assistance to provide (unnecessary as it was). However, I soon realized that one of my cherished, new Kneissl skis (just like those of Finnish jumping star Matti Nykaenen’s) had snapped near the tip. The consolation was a broken ski and not a broken bone. The trial and big error event forestalled the first practice that morning for everybody. The jump take-off was cut back and lowered substantially to bring it into conformance.\nStill a couple of decades away, the advent of permanently located artificial inrun tracks would have precluded this situation by providing an appropriate take-off speed and more importantly, an inrun track accurately orientated to the rest of the ski jumping hill.",

After 2 practice days, the first competitive event was held with team jumping consisting of three and four man teams from the Central, Eastern, and Rocky Mountain regions, respectively. My four man team placed 4th amongst the twelve teams, and although I didn’t do anything spectacular, my individual results were 10th best overall.\nMy second unique experience occurred during practice between the team jumping days and the two final days of individual jumping competitions. Since it was March, day time temperatures climbed to the high 40’s and low 50’s, before falling below freezing at night. On one of my morning practice jumps, I fell forward onto the icy landing hill. After sliding to a halt, I realized that my left forearm was sporting a six inch raspberry that I have to this day. During hill preparation in the middle of a warm day, the landing hill surface was finalized with skis sidestepping down the hill. The resulting small ridges form a nice human cheese grater as it freezes.\nI placed 17th overall during one of the two individual jumping competitions that culminated Junior Nationals week. I never did see the results for the second day, but it was most likely somewhere between 10th and 20th place. The individual winner did ultimately represent the U.S. at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. Nonetheless, my results were encouraging. The point separation between 5th place and 20th place was modest. I could further rationalize that I was using unfamiliar skis and was disrupted by two different falls.\nAs a sad postlude not so uncommon in recent decades, the 1979 Junior Nationals were one of the last times that the Squaw Valley ski jumps were used. They were demolished a few years later and the hillsides were converted to speed skiing and snowboarding. Eventually, an express ski lift was installed in that location.",

He also offered that USSA would pay for new skis. We later found that to be unnecessary since the skis were still under warranty. When I got back home, I exchanged them at the U.P. retail outlet for jumping skis (yes, such stores used to exist) near Champion, Michigan (also home of the five time “All Around Best U.P.

The coaches were impressed with how I had one of the highest vertical leaps measured in the gym. Yes, I had heard that before.\nA welcome diversion was being able to go alpine skiing one day on Squaw Valley Mountain. For a Yooper who had never ventured beyond the upper Midwest until that trip, the week in general and that particular day, was a real treat. Whereas the maximum elevation change at U.P. alpine hills is a measly 650 feet, the 2700 foot elevation change from top to bottom of Squaw Valley was another scale. The picturesque view from the tram ride and the length of the ski runs were awesome. Even for a fit 18 year old, my leg muscles were burning when skiing without pause from top to bottom of the mountain.\nThe climate changed from blustery, cold, and icy conditions at the top to sunny, mid-50’s and soft snow at the bottom. Just as noticeable was that ski attire changed dramatically, as if by magic, from winter parkas, ski pants, and goggles at the mountain top to shorts and bikinis at the bottom.\nThus ended the apex year of my ski jumping career.",

Except for the top flight jumpers with a sterling junior resume’, this means starting in the lower level of senior jumpers, i.e. the ‘B’ class.\nJohn Kusz and I were still able to represent the local club at a number of senior circuit meets. For me, that included Madison and Eau Claire in January, another go at Westby in early February, and then Suicide once again, while finishing up with the annual Wolverine meet in early March.",

John also had other commitments that weekend, so I was allowed to take the family car to southeastern Wisconsin as the solo Ironwood competitor. It was great to have the company of Ironwood native Dave Engstrom (the Green Hornet), who came up from his Rockford, Illinois home base.\nThis time I knew that I belonged on the large hill and rejected any passive thoughts, while pursuing a big hill ride. On the very last ride of the meet, I hit the longest jump ever (279 feet). The ride was effectively weightless as I stretched and peered completely over the front of my skis, just like Wally taught. Airtime was smooth and long, yet it still came to a conclusion too soon for my liking. I had finally created a Class ‘A’ flight angle and position. My body and skis were close to level, eliminating ‘air plowing’. The Green Hornet congratulated me at the outrun. I was definitively competitive within the senior ‘B’ class. This is what ski jumping is all about. Now, we’re starting to get somewhere.\n\n\n\nWestby Snowflake K108 Ski Jump\n\n\nAs a postlude for that day, in the middle of the 270 mile winter trek home that night, the family car began to misfire and then died on a central Wisconsin highway in the middle of nowhere. No offense intended for calling central Wisconsin “nowhere”. Before the era of cell phones and with no credit cards in hand, I was in a quandary. Thankfully, it was not fifteen minutes later that a congenial Wisconsin state trooper drove up and arranged for a tow to a local garage that was providentially open on a Sunday evening. They also had the required electrical part in stock. After the mechanic accepted Dad’s verbal authorization over the wall phone, I was back on my way, having lost less than two hours. It was indeed a good day, from a glass ¾ full perspective.",

    "text": "7.3 Fork in the Track\nAs should be evident if you read this far, I cherish the experiences of ski jumping. But in regard to achieving loftier dreams like national team and Olympics, they remained as dreams. Attending Gogebic Community College in 1979 and 1980 kept my academic costs manageable, but that only enabled me to keep jumping for two years after high school while aging out of junior class. And whether or not I had national level potential, it wasn’t going to happen. With only a few jumps a week, little formal training or coaching, and hill preparation (see Appendix) being handled by a few jumpers and occasional selfless volunteers. But, that’s OK. I received so much more out of ski jumping than I gave.\nAs I eyed what university to attend in 1981 and beyond, I was at a crossroads. Many other ski jumpers have faced this type of ‘go big’ or ‘get on with life’ dilemma. Do I continue ski jumping or launch headlong into an engineering career, or could I do both?\nAbout that time, Northern Michigan University (NMU) launched an adjunct ski jumping team with their home facility (Suicide Hill complex) being one of my favorite sites. I tried every which way to rationalize attending NMU while continuing to ski jump. A shared workload in hill preparation that ensured a lot of jumping time was enticing in itself. The preferred scenario was to be affiliated with an organized team, even if only a walk-on. Ideally, it would be near the watchful eyes of a coaching staff. But at that time, there was no real engineering curriculum at Camp Northern (ah excuse me, NMU), as compared to Michigan Tech (MTU). I was born to be an engineer and that meant MTU.\nBy 1981 when I had become a full time student in Houghton for the ensuing four years, there was no practical means to maintain competitive recreational ski jumping skills, let alone progress to a higher level in the sport. It was still a privilege to compete on the intermediate size hills as a recreational ski jumper, but it was not meeting my expectations by languishing in the middle of the senior ‘B’ class riders.",

After my shortened ankle breaking 1978 season, I was just then graduating to the larger than 60m hills, culminating in a few 90m experiences. But ski flying hills are another step up from the 90m hill class, especially in terms of higher airspeed and negative consequences of any critical mistakes during the ride. So, when I rushed over to the 1981 Copper Peak competition only as a spectator, it was indeed a wistful day to witness several of my Central Division peers riding the Peak, including Mike Shupien, Dave Edlund, and Mike Williams.",

To qualify to ride a sky flying hill like Copper Peak, one has to have the demonstrated psychological make-up along with a considerable big hill resume’, which John Kusz and Dave Engstrom diligently accumulated. Especially in the mid to late 70’s, they committed to cross country travel to compete in national large hill meets.\nIn 1978, John and Dave were a ski jumping mature 29 and 34 years old, respectively, but still at the peak of their game and improving. As well documented, one lifetime achievement for them was riding Copper Peak, followed by a repeat performance in 1981. It was not only a special thrill for them, but for many of the local old-timers who were former ski jumpers. They had dreamed, conceived, and carried the torch for Copper Peak to be built. And wouldn’t you know that there was the Green Hornet still riding Copper Peak as a forerunner in 1989 at age 45 and ski jumping internationally even into his 50’s. Once again, kudos to true stalwarts like John and Dave who stayed actively involved and contributing to ski jumping for five or more decades. Wow!\nThe Green Hornet’s characteristically elegant flight style was recognizable from a hundred yards away. I describe it as a hybrid between 1970’s Daescher, as illustrated by the precisely close and parallel skis, while including remnants of the 1950’s Windisch, which had arms wrapped snugly around the hips and a pronounced but not exaggerated jackknife. With head tilted back from the torso and eyes steadily peering to the hill bottom, Dave’s knifed through the air with an unparalleled steadiness.\n\n\n\nDave Engstrom (the Green Hornet) in Flight\n\n\nAfter I retired from ski jumping and embarked on a 40 year engineering career in downstate Michigan, sincere compliments to the Wolverine Ski Club for what they accomplished from the early 80’s through the mid-90’s. As documented by Supercynski, they refocused on revitalizing local junior jumping. A key step was John Kusz and six companions of the Wolverine Ski Club investing their time in being formally trained as ski jumping coaches. The commitment of many people resulted in a complement of smaller hills along the Wolverine ridge, including a 10m and 35m. That effort bore fruit. Over a 10 - 12 year period, local junior jumpers represented themselves and the club very well at ski jumping meets all over the Midwest and even nationwide. But, similar to my dozen year ski jumping experience, that mid-80’s to mid-90’s junior age class eventually grew up and had to move on to other phases of life, just as I did in the 1981 - 1982 timeframe.",

    "text": "8.1 Physical + Mental\nWhat about the broader view of the sport? Even though the popularity of ski jumping in the U.S. has waned over recent decades, its merits are still compelling. This centuries old pastime fulfills the pursuit of an intense, high speed, anaerobic athletic challenge. In short, ski jumping demands unique physical prowess and mental fortitude. Yet, both a novice and an international champion can safely enjoy the thrills it offers. By these criteria, ski jumping is a top tier sport.\nAn aggregate of talents must be applied throughout the duration of what’s called a ski jump that is much more than a jump, but has a prelude (inrun ramp), beginning (take-off), middle (flight), ending (landing) and postlude (transition to outrun). All of these jump segments must be mastered by an aggressive, but disciplined mindset that does not lose poise nor surrender to doubt, fear, or failure.\nThe excitement of ski jumping comes in multiple stages. Ski jumpers may be viewed as fear defying adrenaline junkies that have downhill skier instincts, embracing straightaway speed down the inrun ramp. Then, he must have a fearless commitment to make a gymnastic-like, cat quick leap precisely timed at take-off. Once in the air, he manages nearly weightless ‘hang gliding-like’ lift with subliminal neuromuscular coordination quickly adjusting to unpredictable air currents, before negotiating a feather soft landing. If the ski jumping ‘pilot’ masters all the subtleties of each ride stage, he will soar down the hill. Well, that’s the goalposts.\nSure, if one can afford it, weightlessness can be simulated in 20 seconds of a parabolic airplane flight, just like astronauts practice. But the impression of speed is zilch. The lift and duration of a ski jumper’s flight (2 – 8 seconds depending on the length of the ski jumper’s flight), amidst variable conditions, is directly influenced by the athlete’s skill. In a parabolic airplane flight, the conditions are created by the pilot while participant’s influence on the result is minimized.\nSports that transcend the sole individual during competition are extra special. Successful team athletes allude to the joy of camaraderie while “climbing the mountain” together, celebrating, trusting, and picking up each other along the way. Sports that are more individually oriented, such as swimming, golf, or ski jumping, can also provide a similar level of fulfillment within a healthy club or team setting. In special circumstances, it is also evident across a community of competitors. Such was my experience with ski jumping.",

    "text": "8.2 How Safe Is It?\nOK, one may be attracted to a sport with thrills and skills, but how risky is ski jumping? With the growing sensitivity to safety in contemporary times, what is the actual (rather than widely believed), dangers of ski jumping? Unfortunately, potential new participants in ski jumping can be deterred, when in the interest of attracting audiences, ski jumping is erroneously portrayed as exceptionally dangerous. Sure, if one wants to toy with near death adrenaline levels, they might try wingsuit flying, but those risk-to-reward ratios are astronomically high. Such is just not the case with ski jumping.\nWhat does the USA Nordic organization, an organization with a vested interest in the safety of its sport, say on the subject?\n\n“Ski jumping is a safe non-contact sport. Ski jumpers develop their jumping skills at their own pace. Each jumper starts out on the smallest hill with alpine skis, and progresses to the next larger hill when ready. Each skier progresses at a pace right for them with safety as the primary objective and with the input of experienced coaches who understand the importance of foundational skills necessary to keep jumping safe.”\n\nWithin the overall sport of skiing, 2006 - 2008 FIS data concluded that injuries causing lost time for training or competitions on a per athlete basis was 15% - 35% less for ski jumping than that of alpine skiers and snowboarders.\nA 2012 Consumer Product Safety Commission study revealed that for children ages 5 to 14 injuries for all types of skiing occurred at a rate of 2 per 100,000 participants. Yeah, two. All of the more common sports or activities (most of them involving some form of contact), such as football, basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer, and playground ranged from 51 (hockey) to 584 (football) injuries per 100,000 participants.\nIn studies of Winter Olympic injuries, less than 5% of ski jumpers incurred injuries, which is equivalent to curling! For all sports, 11% of participants were injured, with snowboard cross, freestyle skiing, bobsled, ice hockey, and short track being much higher than the average.\n\n\n\nWinter Olympic Injury Rates, By Sport\n\n\nIn a subsequent study of injury frequency for the 2914 athletes from 92 countries participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics at PyeongChang, South Korea, data was compiled for percentage of athletes losing time for training or competition to injury. The data was broken into three segments:\n\nAny injury that forced some lost time\nInjuries that forced time loss of greater than one day\nInjuries that forced time loss greater than one week\n\nAll injuries that prevented training or competing impacted less than 7% of athletes. Meanwhile, half pipe skiing, snowboard cross and ski cross, snowboard slopestyle, and aerials led the injury parade at 4X – 5X that frequency. A majority of injuries in those sports resulted in longer downtimes. Amongst the intermediate to high range for injuries were alpine skiing, bobsled, ice hockey, speed skating, and luge. Figure skating, cross country skiing, and freestyle mogul skiing occupied the low end of injury scale. Trailing the entire pack with the least amount (&lt;1%) of injuries are those gun toting biathlon folks (thankfully) and nordic combined (which includes ski jumping as part of their regimen).\n\n\n\nPercentage of Athletes Losing Time to Injury in 2018 Olympic Winter Games\n\n\nIf such data is initially surprising, further inspection should make it intuitive. The impressive aerial skills of halfpipe skiers executing multiple twists, turns, and inversions followed by a mostly vertical descent and (hopefully) an upright landing onto an uneven hard snow terrain makes even superior athletes susceptible to injury.\nAnother relatively new sport, ski cross (formally organized in 1986 and adopted as an Olympic sport in 2010), has four competitors simultaneously racing side by side down a course full of bumps and turns. Their objective is to survive a progression of exciting, but aptly named, knockout rounds to win a championship. The likelihood of contact or injury inducing falls are supported by the data. Without being too poetic, contrast that with a single, well trained ski jumper soaring majestically through the air and touching down gently on an expertly profiled and smoothly groomed landing hill.",

    "text": "8.3 The Agony of Defeat\nVinko Bogataj is the poster child for instilling alarm about ski jumping dangers. You almost certainly know of him, if you were born in the 90’s or earlier. He’s the poor chap from Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) whose cartwheel off the side of the inrun of a West German ski jump in March 1970 was immortalized as the Agony of Defeat at the beginning of every Wide World of Sports show before ABC cancelled the show in 1998.\nA ski jumper of any skill level falling in the inrun is as rare as Halley’s Comet swinging by Earth. The rest of Vinko’s story is that he indeed suffered a concussion and broken ankle, but resumed training by June of that same year. Living in eastern Europe, he didn’t know he was (in)famous until invited to a Wide World of Sports anniversary show in 1981 where Vinko received a standing ovation from a huge assembly of famous athletes, with Muhammad Ali himself requesting his autograph.\nThere is a combination of natural and trainable skills to reduce the possibility and/or severity of injury when a ski jumping fall occurs. Once it is obvious that a normal flight and landing is unrecoverable, the seriousness of the fall can usually be mitigated by piloting to a flat lying position and adhering to the hill surface as quickly as possible.\nOn the few times that I fell (usually 1 - 3 times per season), they were nearly all uneventful. I was fortunate to never hold a yard sale, nor did I personally witness a fall by another jumper that required immediate medical attention. But, as I tease others when alpine skiing or playing euchre, if you aren’t occasionally falling or failing, you aren’t really pushing the boundaries and learning. ‘Going to the edge’ certainly applies to achieving winning times in alpine downhill skiing, but to a lesser degree in the discipline of ski jumping.\n\nYard sale – slang for an epic, violent wipeout where a skier’s equipment (skis, gloves, goggles, helmet, etc..) is scattered all over the landing hill.\n\nThe natural public fascination with hill size feeds the perception that ski jumping is a hazardous spectacle, competing for an occasional spotlight with the obscure and the extreme. Progressive in one sense, the bygone ABC’s Wide World of Sports gave unprecedented attention to humans tempting fate with gravity by motorcycle jumping, high wire acts, or tower diving by men or donkey, but ski jumping didn’t deserve to be lumped with those daredevil shows.\nMake no mistake, at the largest (ski flying) hill class, the risk does increase without extensive training and established hill safety protocol. The attention to subtle wind and hill conditions on the big hills has grown more sophisticated over the years. Extra diligence is given to qualifying a ski jumper to ski fly, based on his or her track record and awareness of his mental make-up.\nBut, with a little internet searching, one can find Go-Pro videos of the usual, safe, and successful ski jumping ride. With a camera attached to a ski jumper’s helmet, the videos do not do justice to the entire ski jumping experience, of course. They do provide a decent introduction to sight lines of a jumper, and a good impression as to how steady a ski jumper’s flight (usually) is.\nTo cap the safety discussion, the age old quote “Most people use statistics like a drunk man uses a lamppost, more for support than illumination” often applies to studies of ski jump fatalities. Statistics on ski jumping fatalities must be viewed with discernment, since the numbers are often grossly inflated by lumping the actual ski jumping sport with failed extreme skier stunts such as attempting to fly over a large crevasse or public highway.",

Archaeological finds near today’s border of Russia and Finland indicate that skis were used at least as early as 6000 BC. In those millenniums, leaping into the air with skis was probably inconceivable unless trying to scale a crevasse while being chased by a saber tooth tiger.\nSki jumping as a recognized pastime originated more than 200 years ago, with Norway attributed as the birthplace, but it hasn’t been a curiosity isolated to Scandinavia. During the late 19th and early 20th century, northern Europeans streamed into the U.S. to work the mines, forests, and farmlands and brought their culture with them, which included their favorite sport of skiing, and in particular, ski jumping. There was a natural affinity for it, encouraged by a sense of family legacy. Perhaps fondness for a sport associated with bravado was to be expected in an era where everyday adult life was otherwise dominated by monotonous, exhausting, and yet hazardous nature of being a miner, logger, farmer, or housewife.\nWhereas the first recorded ski jump (31 feet) is commonly credited to Norwegian Ole Rye in 1808, the first recognized North American competition of the transplanted sport was held in St. Paul, Minnesota as early as 1887, less than two decades after the first formal competition in Norway.\nIn the first 75 years of the 20th century, many American kids were playing baseball nearly every summer day on the streets or farm fields. In the winter, in any hilly neighborhood of the Northeast, upper Midwest, or Rocky Mountains blessed with snow, countless ski jumps (or bumps) of all sizes would appear.",

    "text": "8.6 Evolution of Style\nThe evolution of ski jumping technique and flight style over the past century has been remarkable. In the early 1900’s, jumpers flew with arms windmilling for balance – a style that would be considered comical today. The Kongsberger technique, developed in Norway in the 1920’s, introduced a more controlled forward lean with arms extended ahead.\nThe Daescher style, named for Swiss jumper Andreas Däscher, dominated from the late 1950’s through the 1980’s. It featured parallel skis held close together, with arms positioned at the hips and a moderate forward lean. This was the style I learned and practiced throughout my jumping career.\nThe V-style revolution began in 1985 when Swedish jumper Jan Boklöv discovered that spreading the ski tips into a V formation dramatically increased lift. Initially penalized by judges for unorthodox form, the technique proved so aerodynamically superior that it eventually became universal. Today, all competitive jumpers use variations of the V-style.\n\n\n\nEvolution of Ski Jumping Flight Styles\n\n\nEquipment has evolved equally dramatically. The heavy hickory skis my father used have been replaced by lightweight carbon fiber composites. Binding systems allow precise adjustment of forward lean. Aerodynamic suits, carefully regulated to prevent unfair advantage, maximize lift while minimizing drag.\nHill design has also advanced significantly. Computer modeling now optimizes every aspect of jump construction – from inrun curvature to landing hill profile. Artificial surfaces allow year-round training. Wind screens and sophisticated monitoring systems improve safety and consistency.\nThese advances have pushed jumping distances to levels unimaginable in the 1970’s. The current ski flying world record exceeds 250 meters (820 feet) – more than double what was achievable when I was competing.",

    "text": "9.3 Technology’s Role\nModern technology has opened new possibilities for ski jumping development. Video analysis allows coaches and athletes to dissect technique in unprecedented detail. Computer simulation helps optimize equipment and body position. Virtual reality systems provide mental rehearsal opportunities without physical risk.\nPerhaps most significantly, artificial jumping surfaces have extended the training season to year-round. Plastic matting systems allow safe jumping in summer conditions, dramatically increasing the practice time available to developing athletes. Several facilities now host summer competitions that draw participants from across the country.\nThese technologies have helped level the playing field between American jumpers and their European counterparts, who have traditionally benefited from superior facilities and longer seasons.",

    "text": "9.4 My Hope for the Sport\nHaving experienced the unique joys of ski jumping, I hope future generations will have opportunities to discover them as well. The sensation of flight, the camaraderie of a jumping community, the discipline required to master a challenging skill – these are gifts that ski jumping offers like no other sport.\nFor the sport to thrive, several things need to happen:\nIncreased visibility – More media coverage of ski jumping, particularly at the grassroots level, would help attract new participants. The dramatic visuals of the sport are compelling television, yet domestic coverage remains limited.\nAccessibility – Making the sport available to more young people, regardless of geography or economic background, is essential. Mobile training facilities, school programs, and scholarship opportunities can all help.\nSafety assurance – Continuing to communicate the sport’s actual safety record, countering persistent misconceptions, will help anxious parents feel comfortable introducing children to jumping.\nConnection to heritage – In communities with ski jumping history, reconnecting with that legacy can inspire renewed interest. The stories of past champions and community traditions provide powerful motivation.\nI remain optimistic about ski jumping’s future. The fundamental appeal of human flight hasn’t diminished – if anything, it’s more compelling in an increasingly virtual world. The sport offers a tangible, physical challenge that rewards dedication and courage. These qualities will continue to attract those seeking something beyond the ordinary.",

    "text": "9.5 Preserving the Legacy\nThe preservation of ski jumping history has become increasingly important as the generation who built and maintained facilities through the mid-20th century passes. Efforts like the US Ski Jumping Story Project collect oral histories and memorabilia that document this rich heritage.\nLocal communities are also recognizing the value of their ski jumping history. In Ironwood, the legacy of Wolverine and Copper Peak remains a source of pride. Interpretive displays, historical markers, and community events help keep these stories alive.\nFor those of us who experienced the sport firsthand, sharing our memories becomes a responsibility. The skills, the friendships, the unique perspective on fear and achievement – these are experiences worth transmitting to those who follow.",

    "text": "9.6 A Final Thought\nSki jumping gave me far more than I ever expected when I first wobbled down that landing hill at the Iron Bowl. It taught me about persistence in the face of challenge, about the rewards of disciplined practice, about the bonds formed through shared endeavor. It provided experiences that have enriched my entire life.\nWhether the sport expands or contracts in coming decades, those lessons remain valuable. And for anyone willing to embrace the challenge, ski jumping continues to offer the incomparable thrill of human flight – a gift that has captivated athletes for more than two centuries and shows no sign of losing its appeal.\nThe hills may change, the equipment may evolve, the techniques may advance. But the fundamental joy of launching into the air and soaring down a landing hill remains constant. May that joy continue to inspire new generations of jumpers for many years to come.",

In addition to numerous mentions of Dad as a focal point of this tribute, my own honorary first tier ‘Hall of Fame’ of people would include:\nJohn’s impressive ski jumping exploits are well documented and deservedly so. His love of the sport showed in decades long persistence to ultimately achieving his Copper Peak goal and just as much, continuing to compete at a high level several years past that. Even while the ski jumping culture evaporated in the Ironwood area, his continuing positive attitude and unflinching work ethic inspired me during the many hours of preparing the hills before we could do what we thoroughly enjoyed.\nAlthough ultra competitive and 11 years my senior, he always treated me as a ski jumping partner. Our early morning trips to upper Midwest meets were fun and memorable, even with his intentionally lame ‘Dad jokes’ such as “Looks like we are now entering the town of Donot Pass.” He is a sweetheart even when applying good hearted teasing. The two of us were riding in his car to do an interview at the local radio station to drum up interest in an upcoming Wolverine meet. When I pulled down the passenger visor mirror, he noted that “You don’t need to look good on radio.” Little did he know that I was surreptitiously trying to use the mirror to check out the girl on the side of the road that we had just passed.",

He was an accomplished gymnast and baseball player, besides making his mark as a ski jumper, including membership on the 1945 U.S. Army ski jumping team that competed in Norway and Germany. After putting his jumping skis down, he shepherded the sport in countless ways, being a driving force (and hands on labor) behind creation of the 30m Iron Bowl, the resurrected 55m Wolverine, and the ski flying Copper Peak.\nA past president of the GRSC, catalyst for the local youth program in the 60’s and 70’s, and the master of hill preparation for Copper Peak, he covered the whole spectrum of ski jumping, while running a business. With all that going on, the brief periods of coaching that he was able to spare at the start of my jumping career were an invaluable foundation.",

Since the early 1960’s, Charlie has been the multi-purpose glue (dare I say Super-glue!) for advancement of ski jumping on the Gogebic Range. Always approachable and unassuming, he has filled so many roles over the years from behind the scenes niches not getting addressed to leading a supervisory board out front.\nAs a junior jumper, I enjoyed the sport while people like Charlie worked hard to bridge the gap between ski club organizations with sometimes confusing or competing objectives. Until I had classes with Charlie as professor at Gogebic Community College, I was only superficially aware of the technical skills he had applied to designing multiple ski jumps, including the Iron Bowl, the scaled down Wolverine, and the 1975 Wolverine overhaul. Through it all, Charlie has also been the unflinching flag bearer, ambassador, custodian, and documentarian for Ironwood ski jumping.",

As a soft spoken adult, Toivo (my godfather) was an avid outdoorsman who parlayed that high energy and discipline into being an avid cross country and marathon runner (which in turn his son John excelled).\nHe raised five kids with wife Bertha and worked more than 30 years as a welder and then foreman for the Reserve Mining Co in Silver Bay, Minnesota. In his later years, he expended boundless energy as a founding member (and sometimes called the grandfather) of the 310 mile Superior Hiking Trail, cleared out of rugged forest wilderness along the north shore of Lake Superior that today stretches from Wisconsin south of Duluth to the Canadian border.",

<p>During the 70’s and 80’s, the upper Midwest ski jumping tournament circuit was distributed across the western U.P., southern half of Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota, and northern Illinois. Until the late 70’s, the Gogebic Range Ski Club had a nucleus of ski jumpers who maintained the local ski jump, trained, and traveled together nearly every weekend to a Midwest tournament from the first full week of January through the middle of March. Most of the intermediate to large hills comprising that circuit are mapped below.</p>
<p>Most of us had our own favorite hill, for various reasons. Perhaps it was the air currents on the hill, the detailed attention that the local club applied to hill preparation, the efficiency of meet registration (on-site in this era), or the ease in traversing the snow paths up the hill and scaffold. On each weekend, there were usually two or more senior level tournaments simultaneously occurring on intermediate and large hills somewhere in the Midwest circuit. A USSA coordinated schedule enabled ski clubs to reserve their calendar spot year after year.</p>
<p>As I progressed through a relatively brief jumping career (1968 – 1981), I had the privilege of riding most, but not all, of the intermediate and large ski jumps in the region. However, due to meet cancellations or personal scheduling conflicts, I never had the chance to ride the ‘far south’ hills in northern Illinois, i.e.&nbsp;Rockford and Fox River Grove.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wolverine-regenerated"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Wolverine Regenerated</h2>
<p>In the early 70’s, there were regular attempts at using the scaled down and repaired Wolverine scaffold, to fill the need for a hill bigger than the 30m Iron Bowl. The scaled down Wolverine in the mid-to-late 60’s was handicapped in that it was neither shaped to contemporary specifications nor consistent with its original design roots before a storm raised havoc. It was a hybrid of sorts. The partially salvaged inrun had a steep top half, followed by a sharp transition to a long, effectively flat takeoff table. It couldn’t be used for sanctioned competition although it still provided big air ride for recreational purposes.</p>
<p>It took forethought, expertise, and determination by several stalwart members of the ‘Greatest Generation’ to get Wolverine rebuilt and back on stage in 1975. To bring Wolverine back to life, the ski jumping community was fortunate to have the unflinching commitment of a relatively small group, led by former jumpers, such as Wally Kusz, Bob Shea, Frank Pribyl, Charlie Supercynski and others that I apologize for failing to recall or being unaware. Others with little personal ski jumping history were also very active, committed supporters, such as Ernie Mattson, Ed Lakner, and Don Bull. Their altruistic support was extensive and inspiring.</p>
<p>The entire Wolverine jumping hill had to be re-contoured to the updated profile. Charlie Supercynski led the redesign and summarized the cost efficient material and labor (1). It took intensive effort by a modest size crew to get Wolverine back on its feet, including re-profiling the landing hill, reshaping a longer knoll, reworking the entire inrun slope by moving tons of earth, and constructing an entirely new scaffold on top of it. With the complete revision of Wolverine to prevailing 1975 hill standards, the region could once again point with pride to the historic 55m (some say 50m) ski jumping hill.</p>
<p>Not to rehash its rich history prior to the 1975 rebuild, the new Wolverine established an invaluable bridge to prepare local ski jumpers for larger hills in addition to attracting national level competition. Before Wolverine was re-established in 1975, I was impressed how a few of the more experienced Ironwood jumpers, such as John and Mike Kusz, Bruce and Gene Harma, Russ Anderson and several others could venture to ride the large 90m hills like Pine Mountain or Westby, even though their preparation was limited primarily to the small 30m Iron Bowl, the scaled down Wolverine, or brief experiences on a few other intermediate size hills.</p>
<p>Wolverine had a long reputation of riding like a bigger hill, due to the prevailing northwesterly winds in the Ironwood Township Section 12 Road valley. The face of the bluff upon which Wolverine was built points directly into that wind (and did I mention toward the old Savonen homestead?). These natural headwinds provide jumpers with an airstream comparable to the next larger hill class. A steady headwind favors the aerodynamic lift of birds, kites, airplanes, and ski jumpers. On sunny days with a gentle breeze, it was not unusual to see a hawk or eagle hovering motionlessly high overhead.</p>
<p>After executing an excellent take-off, a ski jumper transitioning into flight position was met by an airspeed differential (skier speed + opposing headwind velocity) that produced an exhilarating lift. With the lower and more lateral flight trajectory of the updated Wolverine hill design, a ski jumper had to take full advantage of the airlift to be successful.</p>

<p>With Wolverine’s reputation for big air and early season lake effect snowfall, it influenced the U.S. national ski jumping team to jump at the opportunity to be the first few to practice and compete on its updated version, prior to the arrival of the regular competitive season.</p>
<p>The 1975-1976 season could also be characterized as a two decade (1960 – 1980) highpoint for local ski jumping, accentuated by the inaugural December 1975 tournament. Besides the U.S. national team and other regional riders, the tournament included seven local jumpers, five of which were in their last year or two of junior class age. Within the next three years, life’s circumstances dictated that all but John Kusz and I had effectively retired from the sport, and I couldn’t stay much longer, retiring by 1981.</p>
<p>During practice on Wolverine, if taking full advantage of top gate inrun speed, you could enjoy long flights. If still 7 – 10 feet above the landing hill after clearing the knoll, you could peer over the skis to the bottom of the hill slope and outrun.</p>

<p>One of my most memorable rides occurred on one sunny, but otherwise unremarkable Saturday afternoon practice. Only three of us were riding one day, so our small crew alternated between being the jumper at the top of the inrun or standing at the knoll to flag the next jumper.</p>
<p>As I cleared the knoll during one flight, I knew it was a very good ride. Like other sports when an athlete is ‘in the zone’, time pauses and sound nearly ceases. All I could hear was a very gentle tap-tap as my ski tips lightly touched each other a couple of times during flight. And then, after what seemed like a long time, the ride had come to an end, and I landed softly as a feather.</p>
<p>An additional benefit of a northwest facing ski hill like Wolverine was that it was mostly shielded from direct winter sunlight which can soften or melt snow during mid-winter thaws, thus requiring extra effort to keep the inrun covered with snow or bring a premature end to the jumping season. The Wolverine inrun and landing were also protected from direct sunlight most of the winter day by trees lining its southwesterly side. (Less favorably, the Copper Peak ski flying hill faces southeast, which increases the challenge of keeping the massive inrun and landing hill prepared with adequate snow covering, especially if a mid-winter thaw occurs).</p>
<p>The first full winter (1976) of new Wolverine tested our stamina for hill preparation since snowfall totaled 265 inches, almost 100 inches greater than an average year on the Gogebic Range. By then, with the number of regularly active ski jumpers in the Ironwood area dwindled to a less than a dozen, it would have been impossible to keep both the Iron Bowl and Wolverine hills in shape. So, without lights on Wolverine at that juncture, jumping practice was limited to weekends.</p>
<p>As mentioned, although the early arriving and late departing snow in the Ironwood area would theoretically enable the longest jumping seasons in the Midwest (from mid-November until late March), the sheer effort for a small team to keep the hill in ski jumping shape throughout the winter did not afford more jumping uptime. More so, once the out-of-town ski jumping meet circuit commenced in early January, the number of weekends practicing on the home hill decreased further.</p>
<p>On an intermediate size hill, such as Wolverine, a solid day of practice amounted to anywhere from 8 - 12 rides. On a few rare days, the number of rides maxed out at greater than 15. Trudging up the landing hill and inrun would eventually be tiring, even for a young, fit athlete. In the late 70’s, when our ski jumping was largely limited to weekends, I personally totaled 175 – 225 jumps for an entire season, including out of town meets. In that regard, I envied some of my peers who had home hills with a rope tow or T-bar which facilitated 25 or more rides a day and a squadron of youth and adults to keep the jumping hill in shape, while generally dealing with less snowfall than Ironwood.</p>
<p>More so, a majority of the other ski jumping hills had lights, as did the 30m Iron Bowl before it had to be abandoned. We competed against clubs where zealous jumpers could accumulate more than 400 jumps a year. By the way, the governing International Ski Federation (FIS) is not prone to sanction international or ski flying hill meet nowadays if the facilities do not include a lift for the ski jumpers from the bottom of the hill to the top of the scaffold. C’mon, man. The hill climb was part of our cross training! In some international circles, there is even loose conceptual discussion about creating a fully enclosed tunnel along the entire length of the ski jump inrun. What?!</p>

<h2 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="suicide-hill"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Suicide Hill</h2>
<p>A personal milestone in 1977 was riding the largest (70m) jump in the Ishpeming Suicide Hill complex for the first time. Listed at that time as a 70m, equivalent to the smaller of the two standard Olympic hill sizes, it represented a step up in hill size relative to Wolverine. The largest jump of the complex grew in stature from being rated as a 70m in the 70’s to now being labeled as a K90. (See Appendix 1 for explanation of ‘K’). Located in a picturesque valley, more recently it has jump sizes classified as 13m, 25m, 40m, 60m, and 90m. It also contained a cross country training center that constituted the U.P. Nordic Ski complex, which over the years has been affiliated with U.S. national ski organizations.</p>

<figcaption>Suicide Bowl Ski Jumping Complex (Ishpeming, Mi)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Rich in ski jumping history, the Ishpeming / Negaunee area has hosted ski jumping competitions as far back as 1882, which influenced the location of the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame. Its inaugural tournament was held in 1925 and is one of the few remaining active ski jumps in the U.P. (The Ishpeming Suicide Hill is not to be confused with a smaller ski jump in New Boston, Massachusetts also named Suicide Hill that was destroyed by a storm in 1938. Uh huh).</p>
<p>What might be viewed as a culturally insensitive name for the Ishpeming hill was coined in 1926 by a local reporter upon witnessing a skier suffer an injury, although non-fatal. He defended the name, quoted as saying “Sure, it’s a good hill, but why not have a little color about it.” That attitude reflected the early 1900’s attitude to amplify ski jumping dangers to attract crowds (and readers), before the broader awareness and increased sensitivity to the tragedy of suicide was realized. Nevertheless, the name has stuck to this day.</p>
<p>Suicide Hill was an annual stop for the U.S. national team, who were respected, if not envied, for their flashy uniforms, equipment, and accomplished coaches. These rock stars of the ski jumping circuit warmed up before the meet by pushing a soccer ball around the outrun, before the U.S. became a competitive participant in World Cup soccer. They also practiced stationary leaps from the ground into flight position on top of a teammate’s extended arms.</p>
<p>If you could competently ride Suicide, most ski jumps (outside of the ski flying hills) were within reach. As I sat with several senior Ironwood jumpers having breakfast at a local restaurant before heading out to ride Suicide for the first time, I couldn’t help thinking that the rest of the people in the restaurant were going on to their safe, mundane day, while we would be flying through the air and ignoring risk to life and limb.</p>
<p>You still had to walk up a narrow scaffold while a jumper zoomed down the inrun a few feet away. And, you certainly didn’t want to have so short a jump as to land on the ignominious ‘cowpath’. That was the narrow snow packed trail that forms across the upper knoll where hill personnel and officials regularly walked to and from the other side of the landing. Of course, they didn’t traverse across the knoll during when a jumper was coming!</p>
<p>As compared to some other hills, Suicide seemed to consistently reward distance when a jump was well executed. The curvature of the inrun transition to the take-off table was tighter than most intermediate size hills, imparting more compression when approaching the take-off. Even today, the take-off table is designed with at least one degree more hang (11.5°) than most other hills. This aligns the flight trajectory more closely with the steep (36.5°) landing table. Headwinds on this larger hill were not greater than that of Wolverine. Spurious gusts were uncommon since the ski jumping complex resided in a natural bowl.</p>
<p>As with any walk in life, one can find humor during incidental, but unique circumstances. At one Suicide Hill meet in the 70’s, the length of the outrun was extraordinarily short and slightly downward sloped. Despite hill design standards existing for inrun curvature, take-off angle, knoll shape, and landing hill slope (and having been more refined since then), the specifications for outrun profiles may not have been specific.</p>
<p>Jumpers ride through the dip of the steep landing onto the flat outrun with the highest speed of the entire ride. At most hills, there is adequate distance to slow down and ease to a stop with a combination of snowplow or other combination of parallel turns. Perhaps the outrun was intentionally shortened so a few more paying cars could be squeezed into the surrounding bowl. So, skiers could not absentmindedly glide to a casual stop. After completing the primary purposes of jumping, flying, and landing, one still had to alertly initiate a sliding stop immediately after the dip to avoid pounding into the snowbank at the end of the short outrun.</p>
<p>During the second day of this particular meet, the accumulated effect of skiers aggressively skidding to a stop turned the outrun surface into an ice rink. Amongst jumpers in queue at the top of the scaffold, we snickered when we witnessed any jumper ahead of us run out of outrun length and crash into the snowbank. It was ski jumping gallows humor at its best.</p>
<p>Yet, we marveled at one jumper who adopted the unprecedented practice of starting to snowplow brake at high speed while still on the steepest part of the landing. It was a freakish athletic move predating Bo Jackson’s famous horizontal run along an outfield wall in 1990. By the tail end of the meet, the hill management finally placed hay bales at the end of the outrun to cushion skiers with inadequate braking skills or attentiveness.</p>

<section id="bulldozer" class="level2" data-number="4.4">
<h2 data-number="4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bulldozer"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Bulldozer</h2>
<p>Bulldozer was a 55m jump carved out of the same ridge where Iron Mountain’s famous 90m Pine Mountain jump stood. It was uncommon for a hill of Bulldozer’s stature in the upper Midwest to have a mostly natural inrun and landing, but bulldozers accomplished that.</p>
<p>I participated in a two Bulldozer meets, including one in 1977. Without a scaffold, it appeared smaller than it was when standing next to its big Pine Mountain brother, but Bulldozer still rode like a larger intermediate sized hill, comparable to Wolverine. I placed well in the meet, but a small, yet gratifying moment was being noticed by Ed Brisson, the previous head coach of the U.S. national team. A giant in the sport, he was involved in countless aspects of ski jumping for over 80 years (involvement years, not his age in years), in addition to being head coach for the Central Division, and later, the U.S. National team. He led advancements in training coaches, hill preparation techniques, and safety.</p>
<p>My interaction with him was brief, but as we know, a lasting impression can happen in an instant. One of the practice days was plagued by crosswind gusts that can create havoc with a ski jumper’s flight. Naturally hands-on, Coach Ed positioned himself on the knoll that windy day, volunteering as the flagman to signal each jumper to proceed when he sensed that the gusts had temporarily subsided.</p>
<p>On my best practice ride in terms of distance and smoothness, I noticed that I landed on the far right edge of the wide landing, barely a foot or so from the deep snowbank. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but during my next walk up the hill, Coach Ed complimented me for handling the stiff gusts so well, while lightheartedly apologizing for flagging me into it. Since Ed was a born Yooper in Munising (which had its own history of ski jumping until the 1980’s), his personable approach shouldn’t have been surprising.</p>
